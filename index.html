    <div class="text">[Music] Bloomberg audio Studios podcasts radio news now we want to turn to that big interview that we had promised you I want to welcome in our Bloomberg television and radio audiences to the special episode of Bloomberg markets seated here with an exclusive interview with chair and CEO of Duane family office billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller. Now Stan in 2021 you had written an opinion paper in the Wall Street Journal that said the FED is playing</div>
  </div>
  <div class="segment">
    <div class="timestamp"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWZR5Ahjjls&t=30s" target="_blank">0:30</a></div>
    <div class="text">with fire and a couple weeks ago you wrote to me and you said that you hope that the FED is not making the same mistake that it had made in 2021 the mistake of being trapped by forward guidance what's at stake here why are you so concerned thanks Sonali it's nice to be here um in 2021 I think the FED did a great job when we were facing a black hole in Covid in 2020 uh they took some very aggressive</div>
  </div>
  <div class="segment">
    <div class="timestamp"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWZR5Ahjjls&t=60s" target="_blank">1:00</a></div>
    <div class="text">actions one of those actions was forward guidance where they to try and settle markets guided ahead to basically a zero interest rate policy I think it's for was frankly for three years um we were all fooled by Covid I was too when when it first happened we're wondering you know are we sinking into a black hole but it was pretty obvious I'd say a month or two after vaccine confirmation which was the fall of 20 that we weren't going into black hole unemployment which I think had been around 14% started to drop precipitously the economy came back um we wrote the article in the spring of 21 because at this point we felt we were like booming and it was it was everywhere in the economy and the companies we talked to and unemployment rate everywhere and the FED wasn't adjusting so they were buying I think 120 billion a month at securities it</div>
  </div>
  <div class="segment">
    <div class="timestamp"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWZR5Ahjjls&t=120s" target="_blank">2:00</a></div>
    <div class="text">might have been down to 95 a month by that time period and rates were still zero and I think had they had a clean slate they would have never been buying bonds to that degree with what was going on in the economy but they were trapped in my opinion by forward guidance it's pretty incredible from from the point we wrote the article when it was so obvious that we even wrote about it um it was 13 months from when inflation went through 2% to when they finally raised rates they also bought 2 trillion in bonds during that period um so I guess the reason I analogize is that today and it it's quite different I had a lot of confidence than that they were wrong on inflation the money supply was growing at 40% as I said the economy was booming this one's much more nuanced however um just look at the asymmetry here back then you go 13</div>
  </div>
  <div class="segment">
    <div class="timestamp"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWZR5Ahjjls&t=181s" target="_blank">3:01</a></div>
    <div class="text">months with inflation through the target goes up to 8 and a half% and you still go another 3 months and you're keeping rates at zero and you're buying bonds like crazy and then you um when you finally move you move 25 basis points and your rationale is we need to see the whites of inflation's eyes and you're saying this one it's 3 or four or 5% okay today um we're still quite a bit above Target depending on which measure you use somewhere between two and a half and three and a quarter uh the economy they've come up with this I guess theory that monetary policy is restrictive because of real inflation rates but I don't really go by Theory I'm a market animal frankly we've found over the years that markets are better predictors than uh professors and when I look at the landscape equities at a record high gold at a record high GDP above Trend credit tight</div>
  </div>
  <div class="segment">
    <div class="timestamp"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWZR5Ahjjls&t=246s" target="_blank">4:06</a></div>
    <div class="text">um Bank earnings and forecasts look good um we don't see any restriction whatsoever crypto going crazy you name it so all of a sudden the crowd that said they wanted to uh see the whites of inflation's eyes and they wanted to be data dependent as opposed to forward-looking are now cutting 50 basis points not a quarter which is what they started of and we're not even to Target yet and this is all on the theory that monetary policy is restrictive so what I would say is this I don't have the conviction I had in 21 that we wrote that article that the FED is going to be wrong but on a risk reward basis I just doesn't I don't think it makes any sense at all to lay out the cards they've laid out and commit themselves through forward guidance once again and what I was trying to say when I was saying um it reminds me of 21 is I just hope if the data don't go with them and</div>
  </div>
  <div class="segment">
    <div class="timestamp"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWZR5Ahjjls&t=308s" target="_blank">5:08</a></div>
    <div class="text">they certainly haven't since they started this narrative they adjust this time and they're not trapped by the forward guidance the way they were in 21. Listen does this mean that you thought 50 basis points was an absolute mistake and do you think that there is a risk of an inflationary spike in the way we saw in the 1970s? Yeah do you have the chart we talked about earlier let's see if we can pull that up there's certainly one that investors have been looking at and while you — so even if we don't have the chart — so in the 1970s inflation came down from a remarkably similar level to where it was in 21 I think 21 peaked at 9 I think it was eight back in the 70s they came down to three the Fed was easing because they had the 75 recession so the FED started easing and inflation went right back up to I think it peaked at 12% when Volcker came in and smashed it. I'm not predicting that but when you're easing into a melt up in financial markets and we have the fiscal policy we have going forward it's certainly a risk and I just I think it's a mistake not to be taking that risk into account.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="segment">
    <div class="timestamp"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWZR5Ahjjls&t=370s" target="_blank">6:10</a></div>
    <div class="text">I don't really understand the rush of 50 basis points and then I think that markets have priced in a 97% cut uh at the next meeting that's all through fed guidance it's funny my my friend Jim Grant who's one of my favorite writers said they're not really data dependent they're forward guidance dependent and that's what they're showing again and look he might be right and I hope he is right but it's a big risk because if in fact they're wrong and inflation takes off because monetary policy is in fact not restrictive and we have fiscal expansion going on and they have to tighten again I think it could be a nightmare for markets and maybe even for the independence of the Fed you can't make multiple mistakes that would have been but I'm not</div>
  </div>
  <div class="segment">
    <div class="timestamp"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWZR5Ahjjls&t=430s" target="_blank">7:10</a></div>
    <div class="text">predicting it I'm just saying why did they go 50 and why do they need this forward guidance. You know I'm glad you brought up the FED Independence I wanted your view on this are you concerned about the independence in the scenario of a Donald Trump win? In an interview just a day ago with Bloomberg editor-in-chief John Micklethwait he said that the job at the FED is to show up in the office once a month and say let's flip a coin. Uh on the other hand your longtime colleague Scott Bessent has been informally advising Trump and floated the idea of a shadow Fed chair — how compromised is Fed Independence at this juncture? Well I think a shadow Fed and this kind of talk is a horrible idea and irresponsible however I think were Trump to be elected the institution will hold. Um I think a bigger threat to the FED would be major major mistakes by the FED. I think the FED is obsessed with soft landings and fine tuning to me that's not the real job the real job is</div>
  </div>
  <div class="segment">
    <div class="timestamp"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWZR5Ahjjls&t=490s" target="_blank">8:10</a></div>
    <div class="text">to avoid the kind of problems we had with a great financial crisis which in my opinion were because the Fed was too easy going into them created a housing bubble and then obviously after Covid not the initial actions but sticking with it for a year and a half or two years buying bonds uh with the money supply exploding to me um they've got to stop the fine tuning and start looking at the bigger picture and committing yourselves now and then if they stick to forward guidance and inflation starts going up again that could lead to a hard landing not a soft landing. Speaking of uh the future of course another big uncertainty ahead beyond Federal Reserve policies the November election I'm wondering what the Druckenmiller Playbook is around this election cycle and what you think the most likely scenario is and how you set up for it. Well it's an evolving situation if you had asked me this 12 days ago I would have said I don't have</div>
  </div>
  <div class="segment">
    <div class="timestamp"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWZR5Ahjjls&t=551s" target="_blank">9:11</a></div>
    <div class="text">a clue it's in a total toss up I still don't have conviction who's going to win on the election but as I said earlier I like market indicators for the economy and for financial restrictiveness I also like them for elections I remember how right the market was on Ronald Reagan in 1980 despite what the pundits were saying and I must say in the last 12 days the market and the inside of the market um is very convinced Trump is going to win you can see it in the bank stocks you can see it in crypto you can even see it in DJT his social media company but throughout the whole I would say the industries that are deregulated if we had deregulation will benefit from Trump or outperform the others so if you put a gun to my head and thank God there's not one so this really doesn't matter I would have to guess Trump is the favorite to win the election now but who</div>
  </div>
  <div class="segment">
    <div class="timestamp"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWZR5Ahjjls&t=612s" target="_blank">10:12</a></div>
    <div class="text">knows what these polls even mean no one even responds to them anymore but um that's what we're looking at I think the Delta between let's say four outcomes blue sweep red sweep uh Trump with a blue branch of Congress uh Harris with a red branch of Congress um first of all I think the blue sweep is extremely unlikely even if Harris wins the presidency uh looking at state-by-state polls it looks like the Republicans are going to win the Senate um where you get a blue sweep I think just the magnitude of taxes um business confidence lack of animal spirits um no change in the regulation front in investors minds you could get a rough</div>
  </div>
  <div class="segment">
    <div class="timestamp"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWZR5Ahjjls&t=673s" target="_blank">11:13</a></div>
    <div class="text">time for equities I would think for 3 to 6 months I think this would probably translate in the economy because equity ownership is 25% of financial assets at an all-time high that was 15% just not that long ago so that's a blue sweep but the good news or the bad news depending on how you view life is I think it's highly unlikely so that Playbook is probably going to be irrelevant so what about a red sweep a red sweep which I think is probably more likely than a Trump presidency with a um with a blue Congress because personally I think anybody that votes for Trump is probably not going to change their ballot um for a Democrat in Congress a red sweep I think you get animal spirits in the business community you get deregulation um and there might be some sort of um uplift relative to where they</div>
  </div>
  <div class="segment">
    <div class="timestamp"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWZR5Ahjjls&t=736s" target="_blank">12:16</a></div>
    <div class="text">were in terms of the business community so I think the economy could be potentially stronger for 3 to six months um my fear would be because of those reasons and because I think bond yields already don't reflect a proper economic outlook you would probably get a bad response in the fixed income markets which could then snuff out the equity rally but any view we have at Duquesne family office where we're worried about bonds we're not playing it through the stock market we're playing it through the bond market if you want to go after the cause rather than the symptoms there still look like there are stocks and things to do I also think under a red sweep the FED for the reasons I just elicited and maybe because of past relationships would be much more hawkish than they would be under Harris Administration so I think that would all be in our Playbook and the responses to</div>
  </div>
  <div class="segment">
    <div class="timestamp"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWZR5Ahjjls&t=796s" target="_blank">13:16</a></div>
    <div class="text">it under a Harris Administration with the Republican Congress probably not a lot of change from the landscape we currently have in terms of trying to figure out what's going to happen. I want to remind our viewers if you're just tuning in right now I'm standing by with Stanley Druckenmiller for our Bloomberg television and radio audiences of course he leads the Duquesne family office and you were talking through each scenario here but what about your personal views here in a recent conference you had mentioned that you wouldn't vote for either Kamala Harris or Donald Trump which concerns you more? Um which concerns me more I haven't — I like um Bret Stephens's line in the New York Times I haven't decided who I'm going to vote against um I can't see myself voting for either one of them so it really doesn't matter who concerns me more and I certainly would never support either one of</div>
  </div>
  <div class="segment">
    <div class="timestamp"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWZR5Ahjjls&t=856s" target="_blank">14:16</a></div>
    <div class="text">them I just think um they're actually unified on some things like industrial policy both of them think apparently the government should have a major role in allocating capital which I find frankly bizarre when I think back 10 or 15 years I'm a reader of Tom Friedman and quite a good writer and he was constantly pointing out how the Chinese model was potentially superior to the US model talking about how nice their airports were and their roads and how they could target certain industries well my long capitalist suspicions have been confirmed and China's been as we all know a disaster with that model but somehow both parties Republican and Democrats have adopted industrial policy kind of throwing free market Reagan capitalism to the side so</div>
  </div>
  <div class="segment">
    <div class="timestamp"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWZR5Ahjjls&t=916s" target="_blank">15:16</a></div>
    <div class="text">the policies in terms of that I find equally bad I find her policies much worse in terms of anti-bigness anti-business and regulation but frankly I grew up in America with a certain model of a President George Washington Thomas Jefferson um Ronald Reagan was one in my lifetime where there was a certain dignity and behavior in the office and I don't judge anyone who wants to vote for Trump but for me um it's just a red line so I'll probably write in someone when I go to the polls. When you think about the policies Donald Trump has put forward a day ago he said to Bloomberg that tariff is the most beautiful word in the dictionary he's negated the idea that many economists believe that this could have many punitive impacts on the American consumer how do you see it? Well I don't like tariffs I'm a</div>
  </div>
  <div class="segment">
    <div class="timestamp"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWZR5Ahjjls&t=976s" target="_blank">16:16</a></div>
    <div class="text">I just said I'm a free market capitalist the only thing I'll say about Trump he's a bit of a blowhard so I don't know whether he's negotiating um with our foreign adversaries and frankly with our foreign partners um I don't think it'll be the end of the world but I am not in favor of tariffs I don't like them at all. You know it's interesting by the way the Biden Administration kept all his tariffs so it's not like I'm a fan of their tariff policy either. What about taxation? At the end of the day you have been very very critical for many years about the US debt load the fiscal situation and there are analyses that say both candidates would increase the federal debt load the committee for a responsible federal budget says Trump more than the Harris Administration would at the end of the day can Congress get away with extending the tax cuts from the Trump era or is there another</div>
  </div>
  <div class="segment">
    <div class="timestamp"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWZR5Ahjjls&t=1037s" target="_blank">17:17</a></div>
    <div class="text">way to really close the gap? Look in my world the less taxes are better but we live in a world that I hope still includes compromise and if there's some sort of agreement for spending cuts I could definitely tolerate tax increases to balance them I will say one thing I don't really like the media narrative which compares fiscal irresponsibility with tax cuts and fiscal irresponsibility with spending and again you're right I'm a fiscal hawk I'm a lot more worried about this and the effect four or five years out than whether we have a soft landing and our economy grows at 1.2 or two this is big stuff we're talking about but tax cuts are accompanied by an addition to the capital stock spending is a shrinking in the capital stock replaced by government</div>
  </div>
  <div class="segment">
    <div class="timestamp"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWZR5Ahjjls&t=1098s" target="_blank">18:18</a></div>
    <div class="text">spending so of the two tax cuts are less bad but personally if I was in government you can't just do tax cuts if you don't get the spending cuts and it was Trump to me that took entitlements off the table in 2016 and that's where the money is so I give him an F on fiscal responsibility also. So I want to switch gears here because we only have a little bit of time left with you I want to talk about the market and I want to talk about how you're looking at certain wagers that you've put on — a while ago we spoke about Nvidia and you had said that it would be something that you held for years and ever since then you held it for a while but more recently you've been selling it off how much do you have left of it and why have you been selling can you see yourself getting back into it again? I've made so many mistakes in my investment career one of them was I sold all my Nvidia um probably somewhere between</div>
  </div>
  <div class="segment">
    <div class="timestamp"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWZR5Ahjjls&t=1159s" target="_blank">19:19</a></div>
    <div class="text">800 and 950 I think it's 1300 on that stock now. You own none today? I own none and the last 400 points it was a big mistake uh in terms of AI and by the way when I saw you at that conference which was 18 months ago I fully expected to own it for years but I think it was 300 and change and um as I also said at a media interview I'm not Warren Buffett so I thought I was going to but what changed is it tripled in a year and I thought the valuation was rich. We are big long-term believers in AI and there's still many ways we're playing AI particularly the infrastructure that's been built out to support the power needed uh and yes I think Nvidia is a wonderful company and if the price were to come down we'd get involved again but right now I'm licking my wounds from a bad sale. There you know the other question I have to ask you</div>
  </div>
  <div class="segment">
    <div class="timestamp"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWZR5Ahjjls&t=1219s" target="_blank">20:19</a></div>
    <div class="text">really quickly we don't have a lot of time but you were saying that you express a lot of your views through the bond market the 10-year hit 4.1% again recently do you think it goes much higher and where do you think it ends next year would you go very short at this rate? I don't know what very short means um we shorted bonds the day the FED cut 50 because we thought it was a mistake um we still have that position it's not so much um I have a view on where it's going to go short term what I do believe if Pal ends up being wrong here and inflation re-accelerates next year bonds could go up a lot — a lot of basis points hundreds — whereas if he's right you might lose 25 or 30 basis points short. The golden rule I've always had is the 10-year should trade around where nominal GDP is which is 5 and a half% so the risk reward to me is being</div>

    <div class="text">short bonds. So we have to leave it there I'm sorry to cut it short but that is billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne family office in a rare sit down thank you for joining me here on set.</div>
