<p>this man made more than a billion dollars last year in a single week that's right a single week that bet was his event has been available for the last ten years and it only paid off at that particular moment then he spent the next few months giving it away sometimes a hundred million dollars at a time what is always said with the mostess money in the West extended in the East week George Soros and find out what drives one of the world's most successful investors this program was made possible by a grant from MetLife with over 120 years experience in financial management sounds there certainly is I was very Sun suddenly did that one needs to look into George Soros is a man of many paradoxes</p>
<p>he's a world-class speculator who sounds and write like an Oxford philosophy professor it certainly doesn't sound like a Wall Street fund manager last year he gave away more than a hundred million dollars in Russia yet he thinks it may be too late to stop Russia from sliding into chaos he's an expert he in Soviet minorities I spoke with George Soros last fall after his great currency coup when he made a billion dollars almost overnight but the more I heard about his recent philanthropy the more I wanted to talk to him again I wanted to find out what kind of man would stake more than his entire fortune against the Bank of England and then give away so much of the winnings they call it black Wednesday the day</p>
<p>that the British pound fell out of the European exchange rate system in London they blamed the man who was betting against the Bank of England and who'd walked off with over a billion dollars in winnings George Soros was declared a villain by the British tabloids and a financial genius by many others did you really bet more than your entire personal fortune on this trade because all the money in my funds was invested in the pound short against the dollar we had about seven billion dollars invested in and there was no way the fund could cover if we lost all seven billion dollars so you personally were liable for absolutely everything you had right what finally triggered pulling the trigger on that bet</p>
<p>well the trigger was a statement by the President of the British Bundesbank Schlesinger that he would prefer to see the Italian lira devalue without mentioning the pound at all so I figured this was certainly a message that he did not have the same feelings towards the pound that he had towards the lira, the trigger really came from Schlesinger Yes sounds like a man who has studied Europe who has great context to knows how these central bankers think I mean I I think I understand how how central banks fit into the political process pretty well when the British finance ministers were caught off guard by the collapse of the</p>
<p>pound the BBC was there the decision is made the pound will leave the ERM to recover when the dust settled George Soros was a billion dollars richer many people have called you a villain for this trade what do you think about that well I think that as a market participant I am acting in a way to make money that is my way of making a living and I think that a world where you can make money by speculating against the Central Bank has grave defects it needs to be improved but I don't think I'm the one to be blamed I'm just following the rules that everybody else is following I'm not</p>
<p>of the world to be sure George Soros's worldview was formed as a teenager during the Second World War when all the usual rules of normal life were suddenly fractured it really started in 1944 when Henry was occupied by Germans and me being Jewish I was in danger of life his father a prominent Budapest attorney who had lived through the Russian Revolution understood the art of survival when the Germans came in he said this is a lawless occupation the normal rules don't apply you have to forget how you behave in a normal society this is an abnormal situation and he arranged for all of us to have false papers everybody</p>
<p>had a different arrangement I was adopted by an official of the Minister of Agriculture whose job was to take over Jewish properties so I actually went with him and we took possession of these large estates that was my identity so it's a strange very strange life for everything I was 14 years old at the time George you've written the second world war gave me a lesson I've never forgotten which was the value of being ahead of the curve what do you mean by that it's being ahead of the curve it's being prepared for change anticipating change trying to anticipate being prepared to respond to it and recognizing what is happening if you can recognize what is happening and be ahead of it you actually profit from the situation I thought Soros was describing</p>
<p>a game of skill at which he was better than most but I was wrong if that's the lesson you took what is the skill or the game that you took away from 1944 what is the skill at which you excel at the game well I think the game is that you recognize that prevailing trends or prevailing valuations are based on a misconception and that that misconception is going to be revealed and there will be a move from one state of misconception to a different valuation and then there's a discontinuity in the first you have to recognize it and you have to respond to it can you give me an example you mean what am I talking</p>
<p>about yes you got it precisely right what are you talking about I'm talking about looking at the world as a great historical development history is being made history is not just a past that we look at it's something that is being made and recognizing this was the very first lesson that Soros learned from his father in 1944 even as a fourteen year old he understood the difference between ordinary life and history being made the current situation in Europe for instance is such a period of far-reaching historical change the collapse of the Soviet empire the the formation of the new world order is some kind of a historical</p>
<p>event you recognize that it's a historical event and you prepare yourself for the kind of changes that it can cause how do you recognize when something is a historical event by reading your books it tells you one thing about book learning and actually doing it another to learn from books and experience I mean from experience I think that what you learned from books is sort of the groundwork from experience you develop your skills and I was quite good at anticipating events at a very young age I was 14 when I was good at it so what did you learn what did you do that trained you in that skill to anticipate events I was playing a game where my life was at stake and I did survive so I obviously I survived</p>
<p>reversed so it was a boom past a kind of sequence and I think that I understood it reasonably well and the same thing would work on the downside and the depression is there a Great Depression anywhere in the world today that has to be reversed I think that we are in a Great Depression now in the world I think that I think the death that we are in condition is very similar to what prevailed in the 1930s why I think that for instance for the first time since the Second World War they say prices are actually falling in engineering the country like Japan for instance that is something that hasn't happened since the 1930s this small trading room in New York Soros trades currency stocks and bonds around the world but looking for the unexpected on a global scale it's not an easy job Saros made one of his biggest mistakes in his own backyard you wrote</p>
<p>that you saw the crash coming in the late 80s and 87 and yet you got caught like everyone else how do you explain that I made a very big mistake in 1987 based on a theory of mine that the crash when it came was going to occur in Japan first and then spread around the world it actually occurred first in the United States and spread around the world and I was on the wrong end in both markets and then there was also a market in between which was the currency market where I was caught and I took a beating on on all three so it was 1987 probably your worst year well no in a way 1981 was worse because I made</p>
<p>less money but I lost a bigger percentage of the money that I had Soros now manages five billion dollars in investments and the Quantum Fund has consistently generated between 30 and 40 percent return compounded annually his colleague Stan Druckenmiller who runs the fund with him says that Soros likes to take a big position let it run and then get out of the way quickly when things go wrong we talked about the 1992 British pound trade how soon after could you tell that it was a big winner and why did you decide to get out after two weeks I knew it was a big winner immediately because I knew that the kind it was clear that Britain was going to leave the ERM so we knew that was the case and it was a question of how high will the pound go so it was something that we just watched on a day by day basis and that's where I have to give Druckenmiller a lot of credit because he rode that one magnificently</p>
