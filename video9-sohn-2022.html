<p>thanks Dan thanks Frank our final conversation today is between John Collison and Stanley dren Miller John is a polymath and pilot who together with his brother Patrick runs stripe I once had the occasion to ask a very experienced flight instructor what criteria he would use to select a pilot to ride with and he said the the key is being able to both keep your eye on the horizon and on the controls in front of you simultaneously thought that was a remarkably good description of John and it also that that ability to go from 40,000 feet to 5 feet without getting Whiplash is a quality that I feel like characterizes many of the best investors including the person John's gonna interview today Stanley Dr Miller John over to you I am delighted um to be joined uh today by Stan dren Miller and look you could say that certain people in the investing World need no introduction and in a lot of cases it might be an exaggeration but I think uh Stan is probably if you were to ask</p>
<p>investors for their role models uh you know Stan would probably be one of the top three names uh that people give you and uh you know his performance over the last number of decades uh probably um makes that very very deserved Stan is also a uh macro Watcher uh and there's no more relevant time for us to be uh talking about that and in fact uh Stan maybe a good place to start is that you know last year year you gave an interview uh and you said uh you know investors are going to stay uh disregarding the looming signs of inflation uh you can't find any period in history where monetary and fiscal policy were this out of step with economic circumstances and that there was a raging Mania in all assets and so you said this uh last summer when everything was still kind of hunky dory uh in terms of the markets and so I don't know maybe you're pretty good at this uh this macro thing and so if that was your prediction um uh last summer which the sins more or less come to pass what are you predicting now thanks John um it was nice of you to</p>
<p>site uh a period that's actually turned out the way I've said because in my career I've said many things that didn't turn out so your your selective picking was uh quite nice look um I I did say all that and I I would just say that a number of things happened since then uh some which didn't surprised me some which did um a the inflation was actually a little higher than I thought it would be although I thought it was going to be above 6% which at this time seemed quite radical um B the bubble has really burst with a Vengeance a lot more than you can see in the S&P lot of very good companies um have been derated 607 % without a whole lot of change in fundamentals so valuations have improved relative they were and then see I'd say</p>
<p>the biggest surprise since I talked last spring was how slow the Fed was to recognize the problem I thought they were slow not recognizing it last in April 21 but they were still buying Bonds in March of 22 and they were still not even pivoting verbally until November I think that period was incredibly costly because a lot of assets uh a lot of assets were purchased during that period that I think a lot of people moving out the risk Curve will lose a lot of money on I would just say where are we now it it's hard to believe given the extent of the monetary policy the last 10 or 11 years I think globally we had 30 trillion of QE um even as late as I think a year ago</p>
<p>there was 18 trillion of debt that was still negative yielding when the world was about to experience 8% inflation it's pretty it's pretty extraordinary so it's hard for me to believe you could have Unwound all that that created in terms of a misallocation of resources in 6 months so my best guess and um this business is about guessing there are no certainties is that we're six months into a bare Market that has some room to run uh for those tactically trading it's possible the first leg of that has ended um but I think it's highly highly probable that the bare Market has a ways to run is it going to be a soft Landing or a hard Landing well the answer is I don't know but the probabilities of being a soft Landing are pretty remote John um historically I think we've only pulled off two or three</p>
<p>in history the one I lived through and remember so well was the 94 95 one but we've never had a soft Landing after inflation's gotten above 4 and a half% and the situation we face now is extraordinary where the FED um where are we these days I guess we're at 75 basis points I can't keep up but even the projections of 2% you're so far behind the inflation rate and there's so much wood to chop and there's been such a broad asset bubble going into it um it's very hard for me to say that the probability is favor of soft Landing indeed I think they aggressively point to a hard Landing anything's possible as I said earlier I've been wrong plenty of times in my career but betting on a soft Landing to me is a real is a real long shot so you think once inflation goes above 5% it's very hard to tame us in a way that's elegant well that's what history says it's there there's an interesting</p>
<p>historical fact which in fact I think is going to be violated but two undefeated records are number one once inflation gets above 5% it's never come down unless uh fed funds have gotten above the CPI well since the CPI is eight that would call for a Fed funds rate of above eight frankly I don't think we'll get there because the extent of the asset bubble and the Damage that would be done think about the fact that we have virtually no bankruptcies and look at the probably the most disruptive period um since the 1890s uh I don't need to tell a founder of striped that um but if you look across the landscape there should have been many many many bankruptcies which have been buried by QE so if in fact fed funds ever got to 8% which by the way I don't think is going to happen um the</p>
<p>destruction would be quite material the other the other statistical fact is once once inflation's got above 5% to use your word it's never been tamed without a recession so if you're predicting a soft Landing you're going against Decades of History Could Happen anything's possible but I don't think it's probable no I think those um historical examples are quite sobering was it you said that once inflation goes above 5% it has never come back down without the FED funds rate going above the CPI yes and the CI is currently eight year-over-year um I actually think think we are going to violate history and it is going to come down I don't know how far but without that happening the second one I think history is going to win that's once inflation gets about 5% it's never come down without a recession and I think a recession is in the cards I just don't know when we have about depending</p>
<p>on who you listen to a trillion and a half to two trillion of excess savings now so it may take some time to work through that savings but given the extent of the asset bubble and the destruction in the markets given what's going on in Ukraine giving zero Co policy in China um I don't take a lot of comfort from that so I assume um and I'm pretty strongly assume we're going to have a recession sometime in 23 I just don't know whether it's going to be in the early part or the later part and again um it's a guess it's not a fact as we talk about what's going going on in the market uh uh or sorry in the economy and not the market you know one thing I find really interesting about your style is people like to trot out the phrase you know the stock market is not the economy but uh you have you know been on the record a number of times talking about how you use the stock market as a signal for what's going on in the market uh in the economy and so you know you have this distributed team if you look at all the you know stock</p>
<p>analysts out there at covering all these different stocks and all these different uh sectors they're kind of like the you know engineer in the cockpit of the train and you know when the uh you know dial starts flashing and you know it's a sign that you can investigate more so I'd love you to talk about this approach where you are using movements in stock prices to decide or to to know that um something's going on there maybe I should go investigate yeah uh one of the ironies of my style maybe it's because I was a Dropout um of a PhD program in economics at University of Michigan is that I don't use what tradition economists use to predict the economy which is things like um employment and a bunch of macro top- down statistics in fact I started my career as a bank and a chemical analyst and over time I learned that the inside of the stock market had a very very preent message about future economic activity and for whatever</p>
<p>reason stocks tend to lead the fundamental by somewhere between 6 and 12 months and you can even go beyond that and look at industries that lead the economy and industries that lag the economy the obvious one that everyone knows about is housing has traditionally been looked at as a leading IND industry retail has a slight lead capital goods lag and what we've done historically is actually even though you refer to me as a macro investor and many people have is we do the macro by a comp compilation of listening to companies and doing a Bottoms Up analysis of companies that lead the economy and comp and I'm sorry industries that lead the economy and industries that lag the economy and if the leading Industries are turning up or turning down that's a signal and that's worked beautifully historically the other signal which I have found quite pre from markets is the bond market um</p>
<p>unfortunately the last 10 or 11 years the bond market has not signaled anything because the central banks took it upon themselves to manipulate bond prices which to me is the 10year treasury has sort of been the most important price in the world and they took that price out of the equation as a Sigler I remember last summer when certain forecasters had a different forecast than my my own kept talking about well the bond market is saying this the bond market is saying that when the tenear dropped all the way from 170 to 115 which by the way I did not anticipate but the bond market wasn't saying anything what was going on is central banks were buying trillions of dollars and manipulating the price of bonds so there was no signal I don't think you get that tainting if you look inside the stock market you could get it in the stock market as whole but if you do this approach where you look at Industries and you which lead which lag</p>
<p>and you put the puzzle together it's been impression over time and it's certainly allowed us to consistently the last 20 or 30 years outperform the FED in terms of economic forecasts I find that really interesting uh you know equities acting as kind of this synthesized predictors for certain industries and so say If you think about understanding what's going on in housing again the economy now what kind of concretely what will you be looking at is it publicly traded REITs is it uh you know the stocks of construction companies what does that process look like for you well there there's you don't need to get real fancy here you can just do the home builders themselves and uh with supposed good fundamentals they've all declined 50% from the high another industry that's been incredibly pressing has been Trucking um and they're down 40% from the high despite the fact that they're all reporting record earnings um an industry</p>
<p>that is not that much of a leader but it's more of a leader than a leard is the retail industry and there's been a lot in the news lately whether it's Walmart or other companies um retail that one's a little tainy you just can't take these things blindly John that one's a little tainted now because in Co retail went to 100% of the it from about 85% because we weren't going outside and traveling going to football games but even taking that into account um retail appears to be much weaker than it should be given what the so-called GDP numbers are printing so right now there's a there's a signal albe it early that um there may be trouble ahead yeah so you look at Trucking stocks being um uh you know down 50% and you say um okay this probably doesn't you know does not bode well for Trucking volumes it kind of has to be the case yeah and if it was just trucks fine but it's not just trucks it's housing it's retail it's all over the place by the</p>
<p>way you can't get too carried away and say that means we're going to have a recession tomorrow morning a lot of these things have longer lead times like six months to a year yes one thing you're also getting at here kind of when you referenced that you used to be able to look at the bond market and kind of now you can can't is it seems um very true that the investors who perform really well over uh multiple decades have to shift stylistically over time and become new kinds of investors I kind of love the stories of you know the the value investors back in the day where if you look at what Ben Graham was actually doing you're hunting for companies where the uh you know Book value is greater than the market cap of the company the famous you know case of Northern pipeline where they're trading at $65 a share and they just had $95 a share of stuff and railroad bonds whatever on their balance sheet and he bought a bunch of their stock and then just yelled at them and complained until they finally dividend it out $95 a share of their assets but that doesn't work anymore obviously you know markets have gotten a lot more efficient and you can't just buy companies that own more assets than their market cap so value</p>
<p>investing has to change and similar you're describing here especially you know the relationships with bonds the relationships with currencies have to change and so I'm curious can you talk a bit more about how you stylistically have had to change the the tool in your tool cast that's really an excellent question and um it's very it's it's right on point because when I got in the business um you could almost guarantee if a company reported lousy earnings open down that day and closed up big that stock market was going to be higher six months from then and vice versa you could almost always guarantee if the econ e looked great and Bonds were rallying that meant the economy was not going to look so great we used to call it price action versus news and it used to be an incredible indicator of security prices partly because of the efficiency partly because I think the growth of</p>
<p>hedge funds we all learned these rules um and partly because of Central Bank manipulation price versus news is a very weakened tool versus 20 years years ago much to my chagrin because I always found it a great warning signal and now a lot of times it may be warning of nothing or warning of something that doesn't exist so that's been um one thing I've had to adopt to I mean frankly when I started in the business I'm showing my age here which was the mid 70s um I started in equities and I also learned particularly in bare markets that I had to morph into bonds into Commodities into foreign currencies things like that I mean one of the most challenging things for me right now is maybe it's says something about My Dysfunctional personality but</p>
<p>I've always made even higher returns in bare markets and bull markets but the way I did it was just pretty much ignore equities take them off the table buy bonds by treasuries and go home well I've never present been presented the cocktail where you have 8% inflation you think the economy might weaken and bond yields 3% it's an analog with no precedent in history so for the golfers out there going into the situation we're describing I feel like I'm about to play around a golf without a driver and without a 60 degree wedge because bonds which have been my go-to asset in terms of of a recessionary bare Market atmosphere they may work but there's a good reason to believe things may be different this time because we've never had central banks with situation in Europe for example we have negative rates with 8% inflation or even here we've never had anything like this so</p>
<p>you always you can't get into black and white that it's an art form investing in from cycle to cycle you have to constantly innovate and not just be a slave to past models so how are you positioning the fund given that you know maybe you don't feel so good about going long equities but your normal Bond toolkit is not working uh quite well is uh you know is the golf thing top of mind because uh you know it's actually hard to you know to do too much uh or uh how are you positioning things well currently I'm very challenged um we were lucky enough to have made some money uh up until now the last six or eight months primarily by having a a let me call it a matrix of short fixed income short stocks and not doing a whole lot in currencies and owning um some of the key Commodities particularly oil and mistakenly U gold but copper</p>
<p>um things are a lot harder now because we're now getting definitive signals that the economy may be weakening particularly at the front end and while I'm not comfortable owning bonds I'm much less comfortable being short fixed income to the to the degree I was three to six months ago when it looked like a much better risk reward and even stocks um so many companies have been derated by 60 or 70% and I've lived through enough bar markets that if you get aggressive uh in a bare Market on the short side you can get your head ripped off in rallies So currently I'm I'm coming in every day and I'm looking at my screen but I'm pretty much taking a break um waiting for a fat pitch I'm not shooting at any pins to use a golfing analogy my anticipation is I will be</p>
<p>going back to the short Equity position at some some point if the market affords me if not hopefully I'll just Sid step a decline that's not the worst thing in the world but the fixed income Market has become much more complicated uh and I'm lucky enough since I play in a lot of asset classes to have the luxury of not playing in one and I don't think I'm going to be playing much in that one going forward the currency Market is incredibly interesting to me I haven't been doing much there and I'm not currently position aggressively there but I will be surprised if sometime in the next six months I'm not sure the dollar 14 trillion has come in here because we were the first to tighten there's a story about American exceptionalism I'm not sure we're so exceptional anymore and if we are I'm not sure I'm excited about what we're exceptional in um so foreign exchange</p>
<p>looks interesting we still own um energy and other Commodities um Ukraine sort of gave that trade an extended life although I must say the energy because of the transition to ESG we look to be short energy for five or 10 years so that could last a while it's so interesting to hear you talk about this stuff because you so fluidly move between all these different asset classes and um one thing that makes me think of is um crypto obviously you've done kind of a little bit in crypto before I remember you saying that it's just hard to guess the size of position that is interesting to you in crypto one thing I was wondering are you seeing crypto start to affect other asset classes and other currencies um I don't know whether I'm seeing it but I expect it to you can't take you can't build over two trillion in wealth in purchasing power and then</p>
<p>take a trillion of it out and not matter John I also have high frequency um signals and they're certainly seems to be a strong correlation between crypto and the NASDAQ I don't think it takes a genius to figure out why so I'm looking at as an indicator that way crypto um you know everything that that Charlie Munger says about it I'm sympathetic to everything that says Bill Miller says about it I'm sympathetic too so I think that's a movie that has yet to be played out and one that I don't want to bet on conviction but I will be very surprised if blockchain isn't a real force in our economy say five years from now to 10 years from now and not a major disruptor with with companies that will um have been founded between now and then that'll do very well but that will also challenge things like our our</p>
<p>financial companies and do do a lot of disruption so I find crypto interesting my 69th birthday is in a couple weeks I'm probably too old um to compete intellectually with the young people in this space but I'm certainly monitoring it and I was going to ask that do you think younger Stan would be kind of diving into crypto more energ energetically I think a younger Stan would be diving into everything more energetically than I'm talking to um it's age is a funny thing I don't um I feel my predictive power and forecasting power is as good as it's ever been the last three to five years but I'm certainly not making 30% net returns per year like when I had clients so I think it's two things yes um I think younger people understand new asset classes better but B I'm just not playing anything as aggressively as I</p>
<p>used to I want to get back to that cuz that's um that's interesting but uh one other crypto related question as I think about um Bitcoin the closest analog is clearly gold and you people talk about digital Gold by which I mean if you want to remove yourself from cash if you want to be independent from inflation your government in whichever country uh uh you're in traditionally gold would be the assets that you would kind of pull back into nowadays that can be Bitcoin and so You' expect their cyclicality to be similar and yes Bitcoin is highly cyclical gold is counter cyclical historically why is that I'm not sure why other than NASDAQ type risk play takers are the ones that send to play in Bitcoin and kagin that are gold bugs and want the world to fall apart playing gold but there's no question and this I've watched and it's gone on long enough now that I believe it that if you believe we're going to</p>
<p>have irresponsible monetary policy and inflation going forward if it's in a bull phase you want to own Bitcoin but if it's in a bare phase for other assets you want to own gold and I think I just articulated the reason but sometimes John I don't care um this has gone long on enough that I'm starting to believe what I'm observing and for sure if I think we're going to have an inflationary bull market um I'd want to own Bitcoin more than gold and if I thought we're going to have a bare Market you know stagflation type thing I'd want to own gold doesn't mean I'm going to believe that in a year but that's my assumption going forward from this point and is that because of some fundamentals of the underlying assets or just based on what you've observed in their behaviors to date it's 85% what I've observed but I would also say it's</p>
<p>the type of investor um overthe counter um Fang type investors if they believe in inflation and they tend to be younger they want to play Bitcoin uh old kudin that that secretly want the world to fall apart they don't own Bitcoin they own gold so but that's kind of cheating because that's kind of a reason I've made up for what I've observed I think you got to you got to know your own biases um yes go going back to how you work and you know kind of the young man's game and things like that um I talked to someone who worked for you who said maybe an underrated aspect of your performance historically is you just work way harder than everyone else and there's few people who have been in the market since the 70s working with your work ethic uh and you know across such a broad range of assets H how how relevant do you think that is or how much truth do you ascribe to that I think it's very relevant um I was</p>
<p>pretty lazy in college and I never considered myself a particular hard worker but I'm so passionate about our business that it's almost like a compulsive Gambler that has a a way to channel his compos and the fact that every event in the world affects some security price somewhere and the fact that I'm so intellectually stimulated trying to imagine the world 12 to 18 months from now versus the way it looks in the present and security prices how they would reflect that I just find it so stimulating it makes everybody think I'm a hard worker because I'm attracted to the game so in this game I am a hard worker but I actually think there's a life lesson there I've seen young people who when they find their passion who had kind of looked like they were lazy or lost their way or weren't very driven become very driven I just happen to be passionate about this</p>
<p>particular discipline so I don't know whether I have a hard work ethic but it that that's the end result of my passion are are you then uh excited about the growth of mobile investing and you know approachable retail investing for kind of a younger crowd because it might pull more people into this or do you think it might get people in for the wrong reasons and it's a bit more of a you know blinking slot machine game the latter I mean given given what's going on the last 11 years with Central Bank policy and the breadth of the bubble I do fear for um you know one of the saying I'm sure you've heard it but I probably heard it the first week I was in the business 50 years ago it still applied bull market Geniuses um I think there's a lot of bull market Geniuses around and it's not that they love the game they love winning but they were surfing with a hurricane behind their back that was giving them these nice waves they they may become very discouraged so I don't</p>
<p>Embrace I've heard a lot of people invas the fact that all these people are investing now in all these and how great it is I don't think it's so great if the story doesn't end well yeah and and and certainly we may see an interesting scenario play out over the next year or two um going back to your style the other thing I found very interesting uh in how you work is this uh you know your philosophy of put all your eggs in one basket and then watch this basket very carefully and you've described uh how you just develop conviction three to four times a year and act based on that and I'm curious if you could talk a little bit more about that like the the spidey sense going off and you know you're clearly in a low conviction time right now but I think that's just very stylistically interesting where you even know how to size up and down your trades yeah it's it's completely contrary to what they teach in business school which is if you're highly Diversified you have less risk than if you're highly concentrated um I don't believe that at</p>
<p>all as an investor when I think most people get in the most trouble is when they have stale long wrs or stale shorts when you've got 15 20% of your asset base or someone times in macro positions I'll have two or three 100% um believe me they're not getting stale and you have to have ruthless discipline and you're coming in every day just to quote Andy Grove you could not be more paranoid and you're constantly reevaluating and I think it leads to an open mind so yeah I would also say people asked me what I learned from George Soros um I thought when I went there I was going to learn what made the Yen and the deuts mar go up and down and that kind of thing no what I learned was um sizing is probably 70 to 80% of the equation it's not of whether you're right or wrong it's how much you make when you're right and how much you lose when you're wrong I've also</p>
<p>found as an investor I believe in streaks you see it in baseball you see it in everything else I see it investing sometimes you're seeing the ball sometimes you're not one of my number one jobs is to know whether I'm hot or cold and when I'm hot I'm supposed to turn the dial way up not not say okay I'm up 40% this year let's go this will look good at the end of the year go take a break no you got to make hay while you're hot and then when you're cold the last thing you should do is try and make big bets to get back to even you should you should tone yourself down so believe it or not that's that's part of the all your eggs in one basket not only do I have to see the see the investment that really excites me I also have to see myself sort of being in a good in a good trading trading Rhythm I think this is so interesting this notion of first off having hot and cold streaks because I think you know some people take issue to that you know</p>
<p>people debate whether Hot Hands exist in basketball and all this sort of stuff but kind of believing in that but also being kind of self-aware to know that I am cold I'm going to do trades but just small ones to you know keep myself from doing anything stupid and then as you say kind of when you're hot uh uh really being able to kind of size with conviction based on that do you know when other people are hot by the way so people at the firm now at Duane do you know when to egg them on to size up their positions because you can tell they have it together I size up their views and the answer is yes so the Dark Art of technical analysis um there are technicians out there they're all rational they all look a lot of history no one runs more hot and cold and technicians one of your main jobs if you follow technicians is to know when they're hot and know when they're cold some of them that get so cold you can actually fade them and go the other way because they've got themselves all twisted up it's more fun to follow one who's hot and make money with them but</p>
<p>but yeah absolutely I see guys within my own firm analysts who recommend things and they go on streaks too where they get an area and they they're really hot and my job as a trigger puller is to size them up the other thing I find so interesting about this Dynamic uh in terms of working with your team is the uh invest then investigate uh idea and I remember talking to someone else uh who works at Duane who uh you know described the terrifying feeling of having joined and your telling you about an idea uh you know before lunch and then they go out to lunch and they you know come back and they find that you've put on a massive position based on this just idea that they thought they were telling you and you're actually trading on and so can you talk a bit more about kind of why that matters you know why it makes sense from an EV perspective and kind of any stocks where it worked particularly well well you mentioned earlier that the business has got a lot more competitive than it was 20 or 30 years ago there is so much information out there and so many smart people in our industry have come in since 2000 when the financial</p>
<p>renumeration went crazy that you just don't have the time you had when I got in the business when you hear a good idea if you wait two or three weeks a lot of times now believe it or not 60 or 70% of the move will taken place maybe not the long-term move but entry price is important and it's important psychologically as you add over time so yes look if some if some analyst comes in with a great idea or an idea I don't just buy it and then go tell them to do the analysis but if they have an idea that appeals to me intuitively and I really like it and it might fit in with the macro M Matrix we described earlier it might tick a bunch of boxes I mean let's just suppose somebody came in today with a copper company not because they were bullish on copper this particular company um had a new mine coming on and</p>
<p>for whatever reason they love the management it would matter a lot if before they ever came in I was already bullish on copper going three to five years out so yes I might put on a very large position and then over the next two or three weeks tell them to really do their homework and really grind down and if the story panned out add to it if it didn't pan out just get rid of it I've just found John particularly the last 10 or 20 years you just don't have time anymore to do Deep dive analysis the world you do but if you have the intuition you buy it and then you do the analysis and then get rid of it if it doesn't pan out as opposed to wait and do the analysis and it's part of the idea here that if you're wrong you know the position is probably Net Zero when you exit if you're right then you got in a favorable time so there's an asymmetry there yeah it when when you enter it there's no story out there so hopefully</p>
<p>in 10 days if you're wrong there's still no story there's not going to be some bare story because the guy's giving you a Bull story um but if there is a bull story it's quite likely that somebody else is going to discover it over the next two or three weeks these analysts go out to dinner with each other like four nights a week and tout their ideas and a lot of times they don't wait for the portfolio manager because they're trying to make themselves look good with the other guys at dinner too I used to do that when I have more energy um and then are there any cases where this memorably worked quite well oh sure um i' I'd say there are a number of them um I mean there's so many of them I I don't really need to point them out but uh yeah it it it works it it's a much better method or I still wouldn't be using it I've had 40 Years of test cases to do it to do it with it yeah um the other thing on the hot and cold thing that I think is so interesting is um so everyone knows the</p>
<p>famous story of uh you know you and uh 2000 where uh you know you were getting frustrated watching uh you know others at your firm earning like eight% a day during kind of the go- go uh uh last days of the tech bubble uh and uh you know you thought all the these tech stocks were crazy you had been short the tech market and um uh and so you know you against your better judgment you kind of maybe knew deep down it was a bad idea you uh put on uh you know a long trade or a few long trades uh uh you know very briefly before the uh the market crashed and then you kind of knew you shouldn't do it and then you did it and then you did it and it kind of worked out poorly and you know famously you said um that you know what did I learn from that I learned absolutely nothing you know I knew it was a bad idea at the time I think that's the version of the story that everyone knows I think the longer version of the story of both being kind of significantly up and being kind of right in the shorts is uh super interesting and then the kind of cold period followed by the hot period that</p>
<p>came after that in 2000 so I was wondering could you tell kind of the longer version of that because I think that's really interesting and gets to this the importance of not only being rice but knowing that you're rise when it comes to being a Trader yeah the the long version is very simple it actually started quite a while before I um I I didn't do it in the beginning but sometime I believe in like March of 99 I got the brilliant idea to short like 10 internet stocks which were up like seven or Eightfold at Soros and I think I put 200 million into the quantum fund short and within about four weeks the 200 million investment was a $600 million loss I didn't just misstate that I lost eight times I'm sorry four times um well three times my investment so because the 200 million went to 800 million then I covered it so I was very bruised I was down mid teens I'd never</p>
<p>been down double digits before and I was I was exhausted and then I kind of backed off and for a few months I realized Greenspan was doing this h huge easing program because of the Asian financial crisis but there was no crisis in the United States but we were pumping all this money in and I could see the the tech Revolution and I said oh my god I've got to go along so one of the things I did was hired two two people in their 20s who were sort of Gunslingers because I knew gets back to Bitcoin now I knew the younger people knew the new companies like veritos and verisign and that kind of stuff I didn't know how to spell them so we then I'm down like 16% or something we pivot into this stuff in the summer and by the end of the year we're up 42% net uh we have this massive year I go into George in January and I said this is crazy we're in a bubble I'm</p>
<p>selling all the technology stocks so I sell them this is January and then the two Gunslingers are still there they have little small accounts so I can size them up when they're hot or cold per earlier conversation and as you just said they're making like 8% a day and it's driving me out of my mind because I'm out of the market so we're now getting into March and there's the little devil here going March of 2000 the little devil here is going do it do it and the little devil here is saying don't do it don't do it and I think I missed the top by an hour and you said bought a few things I didn't buy a few things I put like I think six billion and which turned into a massive loss two or three billion um I knew like an five days after I did it but the whole exit it was messy so now I'm down like 18% again and</p>
<p>I had just been down 18% the year before and I'm literally like an emotional mess and to your point I know I'm an emotional mess so I go into Soros and I say I'm quitting um I need a break I'm exhausted I write a letter to the cane investors I had I had you know two firms going and I said I'm I'm going on sabatical I might come back I might not right now I'm a mess if you want your money here's the number just call we'll send you all your money back I did cheat a little I said if you take your money out I might not let you back in but you're free to take it all out okay so I go to Africa with my kids I don't allow myself to see a TV or to read a financial newspaper so I don't know where anything is so it's a true break which is something I'd advise young traders to do if you take a break take a break don't sit there and like</p>
<p>trade your own account and mess around so I come back on Labor Day because my kids are going back to school and I'm sure my wife doesn't want around the house so I open up a newspaper and I can't believe it the NASDAQ has recovered like 70 or 80% of their losses the S&P is almost back to the high but oil is up interest rates are up and the dollar is up by the way that might sound a little familiar and this has always been terrible for corporate earnings looking forward so I mentioned this to my good friend Ed Heyman I go what's going on and uh I said oil is up interest rates are up and the dollar is up why why is the market up in the meantime I'm calling all my ex-clients who are small businessmen I didn't have big fancy clients and they're all telling their business is terrible okay so Ed sends back a regression thing two days later showing that if you have oil interest rates he he plugged in the percentages and the dollar up this amount earnings</p>
<p>the next year forward based on history go down 35% % and the average earnings estimate of the Wall Street guys is up 18 so I then get the idea and I'm down and one of my trading rules is you don't trade a lot when you're down but I've had a break my mind is fresh I just love this idea so I put 350% tenure equivalent of the fund into um treasuries betting that Greenspan as a tightening director will reverse and we'll go into a recession and to make a long story short I make 40% in the fourth quarter even though I had given up on the year and decided I was finally going to have a down year that's the end of the story but importantly you think you wouldn't have had the conviction to actually do those trades at least in the proper size you not Tak I will go to my grave believing if I had sat in my office whole year grinded away looked at</p>
<p>the screen I would not have had my brain was too messed up in May and it would not have gotten unsed up watching that price action I will go to my grave believing it was by stepping aside and clearing my head that enabled me not only to see the trade but to have the gpin to put it on in size because I needed that four months to rebuild my confidence you you kind of talked about being low conviction now you know you're not actually short equities though maybe you'd like to be or you think you at might be in future what do you think getting to higher conviction in the current envi environment might look like oh I think if if the market were to Rally 15 to 20% from here over the intermediate term I'm going to take a shot because six months bare markets preceded by asset bubbles don't exist historically and I think we still have a lot of wood to chop um if I you're</p>
<p>rating for the dead what's that you're rating for the dead cat pounds you're rating for the uh the fs it might not be so dead that's why I'm not still like invested the way I was two or three weeks ago I was quite short um interest rates I want to hear where the FED is I want to follow the company data we're following to to see how this thing is unfolding and then of course there's this whole inflation debate and and I could see like the FED says food and energy don't count because they're core we'll tell that to a labor union who what do you think they're going to go in there and they're going to negotiate say okay guys don't worry we only need 3% because the core PC is only up 4% we're not worried about the fact that our own cost of living is up 16% so I want to see if that's embedded I want to see all this by the way one of the reasons in addition to low conviction ition is back to what we're talking</p>
<p>about I'm taking a mental break I'm at work but I want to be fresh and this has been a lot of activity the last four or five months and it may be in a week it may be in three week maybe three months I'm in no hurry here I'll need to you're you're tapering before the marathon you're giving yourself a break before you expect to get pretty busy or I'm in the marathon and I'm not running full out on the on on mil 16 yes yes um if you were what do you think 20-year-old Stan dram Miller today would be getting into or doing differently as you just look at or maybe you know this comes up in as you give advice to you know I know you talk to kind of college students a bunch and things like that but again the investing game has changed a lot and so uh you know maybe it got made more sense to get into bonds back when you could do interesting things there back when the market weren't so uh so wacky as they are today you have a particular skill set you know you're you're not going to</p>
<p>learn you know entirely new domains maybe kind of at this stage and so if you have a very sharp very hardworking investor who is looking at what should they become an expert in to be really successful where would you be steering them that you know is maybe different to where you play well the first thing I'd tell them is if you're not really passionate if you don't love this stuff go do something else and I've hired guys with IQs 50 or 60 points higher than me who stink in my business because and by the way they could be off inventing or or starting new companies that could do very well but um I actually think the next four to five years are going to be tailored to the skill set that worked for me in in the 80s and 90s which was all sorts of macro chaos and I would encourage them to</p>
<p>learn all the asset categories and how how they integrate not easy if I was a tech investor um I would certainly be learning you know we had the internet wave we had the cloud wave Cloud doesn't look like it's over yet but I would certainly be look be looking into blockchain very deeply and the possible disruption it might take but I think fundamentals are fundamentals look when companies are losing money capaity is always going to shrink and their margins are going to look better in three years when companies are over earning their margins are going to come down in three years I think all that stuff will be out there I think the great thing about my original Mentor Spiros dris in Pittsburgh was he made me focus on what moves the stock price like you can't just say Stan okay this is a great company and the earnings are great he said tell me how people are going to think differently in 18 or 24 months</p>
<p>about the situation than they're thinking now that would be my number one advice to the young people do not do not invest in the present the present is not what moves stock prices change moves them and I want you to try and envision a different world in a year and a half from now and where these security prices would trade versus now given the world you envision that would be my number one advice to a young person getting in the business didn't that happened to a surprising extent during covid that people were always investing in the you know the present where Airlines will never make money again oh actually airlines are fine you know a bunch of Internet beneficiaries are the greatest stocks in the world oh actually maybe they're just kind of normal companies but why it kind of it seems like the stock market was pretty inefficient over Co why why were been investing in the pr rather than two years out I think it's what you said earlier I think a lot of new investors particularly retail came in and they were rewarded immediately in the early</p>
<p>parts of Co supposedly there's like 400 billion in retail in the market now that wasn't there two years ago so they were rewarded immediately by buying Amazon and buying the stuff you know huge obvious immediate pelaton Co beneficiaries but they'd never played the game I didn't have I don't have the nerves I used had but this was the was the best short selling period I've ever seen the last year or two because never before were there such obvious over earners like particularly brick and mortar retail you know you see companies that don't grow for 15 years and all of a sudden um and I'm not talking about Amazon I'm talking about old brick and mortar companies all of a sudden the stocks have quadrupled it didn't take a rocket scientist to figure out two or three years from now oh people will start traveling again uh you know uh</p>
<p>companies will will overspend you know all the stuff that typically happens so I think Co was a unique opportunity I think the fact that all this new money came into the market made it even more unique and and exaggerated in terms of opportunity is that a common way you make money in equities is kind of spotting mean reversion or uh noticing where people are maybe valuing a company based on last year's results as opposed to the steady state performance of the business I have a bias toward growth stocks um luckily not so big of a bias that I didn't uh ignore it um the last year or two but I think if you can Enis Vis A company that 3 to 5 years from now is going to be in a much much better situation than it is today um long term that's my bias where to go but yes um on a cyclical basis I've always done what</p>
<p>you said maybe because one of my first groups was chemicals and they were really easy John when they were losing money you were supposed to buy them because everybody shut capacity down the next two or three years but people are still going to need chemical and when they made a m made a bunch of money they used this was the markets weren't efficient they used to announce all these capacity expansions so you knew what was going to happen well i' taken those lessons you know forward 30 or 40 years and they still work so yeah I do a lot of counter cycal stuff but really I'd say the biggest money I've made in equities have been in Gross stocks over time um when you talk about your buyas for growth stocks is Big Tech getting kind of too cheap uh for you to uh to to not be in it as you look at a lot of um the the gaffas I mean they they earn very large amounts of money and so is that uh is that something that's starting to become attractive to you not yet I'm just too</p>
<p>um I'm too bearish on the world um to go there yet although I will say that they've gotten too cheap for for me for them to be my shorts anymore they were widely regarded as uh over earning over earners in covid and maybe they were early on but it was so widely broadcast the true over earners were things to me like retail Trucking or today ocean ocean shipping companies just have these massive margins I can Envision a world where World Trade is not booming in two years by the way um so I think it wasn't obvious it was obvious who the over earners were the that first six months all you had to do is go down the chain and pick them off the last year and a half it's gotten much harder because 80% of that set is already down to a place where I'd rather not play and I don't have my sandwich I don't have bonds um to go to and just ignore that</p>
<p>world yeah and uh how about energy you mentioned the world being short energy how do you actually um put that into uh how how do you actually trade that we're there I mean it's been widely publicized people looking at 13fs by the way which I would caution against because that's old data and in this case with us it's true I'm very nervous because it's not the unique thesis it was six months ago in terms of looking out 18 months where these companies might be but I think the reasons we're still there is we just see this thing as being more sustainable because of ESG and all the reasons we all know about um that it can last a while and that doesn't seem to have been priced in the stocks but it's not a classic Duane play because it's now become widely recognized but I don't just sell something because people talk about pain</p>
<p>trade I don't care about pain trade this or that um we we think these companies are still cheap relative to what we see a year or two out the big problem would obviously be if you have a horrendous worldwide recession but we'll look for um we're looking for demand destruction in energy but so far we don't see it makes sense makes sense um maybe to uh to close out you know if we go back to um you know one other prediction I don't think I'm Cherry prediction cherry picking um good predictions I think uh I think you've just had a lot of them but obviously you know you were warning at this very conference in at 2005 17 years ago you were warning about you know the prospect of a you know a great financial crisis and you were uh you were very bearish at that conference and so kind of like uh you know doctors or nurses use the Pain Scale one to 10 in terms of what what you're feeling if we say one is everything's great feeling super excited about the economy and the market H just couldn't be better and 10 is Max</p>
<p>on the uh bearishness scale in uh in this context where you know maybe you were at a nine back then when you were when you warning about this back in 2005 how would you describe where you are today I'm glad you asked this because this is my 45th consecutive year as a chief investment officer and in 45 years I've never seen a constellation while I was a practitioner or frankly studied one where there's no historical analog so right now I probably have more humility in terms of My Views going forward than I've had maybe ever but I would say if I have an objection out there in 2009 I made a statement inside the firm was well we won't have another financial crisis for 30 or 40 years because once you have one of these</p>
<p>everyone learns from it and we get disciplined and it takes them that long to screw up again the last one we had was obviously 29 I'm not so sure I buy into all this stuff about bank balance sheets and this and that what the central banks globally have done the last 10 or 11 years I'm not predicting this John but it leaves me open-minded to something really really bad um so that's the guy on this shoulder we were talking about earlier um the other shoulder is saying this is an analysis harder than you've ever faced in 45 years so please be open-minded because this is not a story we've seen before so the ending is not as predictable as it has been in other parts of your career Two 2005 was a no-brainer I thought by the way I didn't make much money in ' 06 why was it such a no-brainer because I looked at a housing chart and for 50 years it went up like</p>
<p>this and then in five years it went like that and I knew that people had taken 800 million home equity loans out and spent it and I knew that all this stuff was going to come back on the bank balance sheets because they had secure artize this stuff with Clos and stuff but they had done it in a way that it could come back and I had a brilliant analyst from Leman Brothers come in sort of your story earlier probably the best example of it lay out the whole subprime thing for him and he said by the third quarter of ' 07 all hell's going to break loose and by the way by the time he left that meeting over the next two days I shorted everything to do with housing and in ' 06 I was wrong for six months it drove me crazy um but the analysis was consistent so the the deeper we dug the more confident we</p>
<p>got so uh you know you said after uh the GFC that we won't have another financial crisis like this for 30 or 40 years now you're not predicting it but you're just saying you're not so sure what could that look like you know is this you tied it to money printing is this a uh you know dollar losing Reserve currency status issue is this a you know another banking crisis plus again I know you're not saying this will happen but as you think about the Grim scenarios what what could they look like I I'm really not predicting this but think of the 30s a post asset bubble just absolute destruction in buying power going forward and then do we have the FED pump it all up again and we get some kind of horrible sort of stagflation thing or do we actually get deflation uh I hate to be a hedger but somebody always ask is this going to end</p>
<p>in inflation or deflation I go I don't know 70% inflation this was a year and a half ago um 30% deflation they said what do you mean deflation I said well we've never had inflation because we were too close to the zero bound that's why I was so angry at the FED about worried about 1.7 every deflation has preceded an asset has followed an asset bubble and since the FED has created the biggest asset bubble and by the way there other Central Bank rather in history and the broadest even though a lot of the air has been let out of the balloon it's so big I just have to be open-minded the consequences so we've had two really bad ones in the last 100 years the US in the 20s and Japan in ' 89 they're still suffering so it could be just no growth and sideways for 15 or 20 years like 66</p>
<p>to 82 in terms of the markets or it could be something more pernicious like we had in Japan frankly I don't know um I'm just trying to be open-minded I am you're reminding me as as you kind of talk about some of these scenarios and you know you think we're maybe not being imaginative enough in our pessimism and and I you know think about your um various predictions I also you know I enjoy reading Paul singer's letters at Elliot and he's always you know complaining about uh nerp and zerp and uh you know the propagate uh uh policies of governments around the world but you know it feels to me that macro Watcher or macro investor is kind of synonymous with macro pessimist why is that um for some reason it's like intellectually stimulating but I would say one practical reason is in in bare markets that's when macro make all their money because that's when you have the or used to have the biggest Bond moves</p>
<p>and the biggest currency moves this stuff really moves in chaos so a macro investor sort of helps roots for chaos and we're all competitive Fanatics so you also outperform everybody on an absolute and on a Rel basis I think that's one and I would also say that Paul and I have the same disease which is I started the business 76 the first five years were a bare Market I did well I have a bearish bias I know it one of my jobs is to manage myself and know that that bias exists but it does exist in me and your listeners should be aware of that so maybe all this pessimism I'm spewing uh isn't going to happen well no but you're interesting right because you're you're a bearish but uh or a bearish bias but you're also perfectly happy going long equities growth stocks everything like that and so you have plenty of options in a bull market yeah and I I frankly made a fortune from 82 to 87 I was a Ronald Reagan nut and I</p>
<p>was wildly bullish and uh I was bullish you earlier you were massively up in 99 yep and frankly from 95 to 99 I did really well um yeah I look there was an there was an old time where most of your um listeners won't know this guy Robert Wilson one of the greatest short wellers sellers ever it's really cool to make money in a short because it's different but any great short seller will tell you they made 90% of their money on the long side the math is with you yeah well I I think you've given me lots of uh reasons to sleep worse tonight uh and new things to uh to worry about so uh uh that is exciting but I do think it's very thought-provoking that maybe we are not being imaginative enough about uh about the things that could go wrong and again you know tying back to your story um uh about uh you know the year 2000 when uh oil's up interest rates are up and the dollar is up it has not historically tended to uh to portend well for the economy um I I</p>
<p>would also say that two guys Warren Buffett and Ken Lang goon that have done quite well say never bet against America so I think um the audience has to keep that in mind too yes though that has always been true over the long term yes yes with underlining the long term yes well St listen this has been an absolute pleasure uh I I found this fascinating and so just really thank you for your time and uh excited to uh uh to uh to see you at the next one thank you John and uh I think we're both happy to do anything for Iris so and their contributions have been a measur able so appreciate it thanks Sean</p>
