      <div class="transcript-body">
      <p>[Music] hi everybody I'm Nicola tangan the CEO of the Norwegian Sovereign wealth fund and today I'm here with Stan Ren Miller at proper legend in the investment World San what a pleasure to be here happy to see you niai now what are the most important data you're looking at these days currently yeah interestingly enough I'm known as a macro investor but I do a macro from the bottom up so we're listening primarily to companies and we're not seeing any material signs of weakness other than maybe in the housing market but that's from a very elevated price level so we're not seeing bottom up in information indicating to us that there's an economic problem anytime in the next 3 to six months I would also say I'm revealing now that I'm more of a market animal than an economist that we look at Financial conditions they've been very very loose</p>
      <p>I mean they're is looser looser than they were when the FED actually started tightening they've tightened considerably in the last four or five weeks ever since the ironically ever since the FED cut because the dollar has ried and obviously interest rates have gone up but they're still they're still quite above normal so that's pretty much the data we're looking at I'd say the other thing I'm focused on I've been obsessed with whether we were in the 70s um really since 2021 when this whole inflationary episode started and I'd say two years ago or a year and a half ago I was very confident that inflation was going to come down which I was right on but I was worried about the economy which I was completely wrong on um more recently and you can take this with a grain of salt since I had one right and one wrong there um I've switched to</p>
      <p>being more worried about inflation going forward uh than the economy itself why do I say that if we go back to the 70s there was an episode with OPEC that set off an inflation you had a recession and inflation came down I think from about 8 to 3 and then went back up again yes and what Bo what's bothered me and what I have wanted to say you're exactly right it went back up again it went back up again and the number of months um would correlate to the bottom being right about now yeah so my confidence a year a year and a half ago was we're going to have that period where we came down again and then we'd see and I'm a little worried that the FED has declared Victory too early I don't have conviction like I had in 21 that inflation was going going to go up that's when the money supply was growing 40% and all sorts of things were happening but I also don't have</p>
      <p>conviction that they've snuffed this thing out and won the battle and to cut 50 basis points with credit spreads tight gold at new highs equity's roaring no sign of weakness um material weakness in the economy of course there are some spots um that just makes me nervous that this thing could turn up again what would make you turn up again what would be the factors I think what I just said uh easing into Financial conditions let's say um Trump wins if Trump wins you could have animal spirits from the business Community who are dying for deregulation you could have tariffs which are on the margin inflationary uh immigration has been a great Boon to this country maybe not the way it was done but it certainly enabled us to have growth without inflation and labor materially the last two or three</p>
      <p>years so the combination of animal spirits recovery doing better than it is I'm just open-minded to it again why is it so urgent for the central bank to cut given this honestly um I don't take the nefarious view that pal is doing it for quote unquote political reasons I do think he's obsessed with the soft landing and I think he's obsessed with his legacy and having made the mistake he made in 21 and he's being egged on by other economists in the press to me the fed's job is to avoid the big big mistakes yeah like the 70s like the great financial crisis like the big inflation we just had but all this fine tuning and woring about a soft Landing that that is not the job of the FED in my opinion is to maximize employment for the long term not for the next three months or the next four months but I think the fed's obsession with nailing this so-called soft Landing I would</p>
      <p>remind everybody that the reason we're having a landing is because they took they let inflation go from 2 to %. yeah so there was no need for a landing for 20 years but um I think that's what they're obsessed with I don't really I don't know how much of a problem is the forward guidance it's a huge problem um my friend dream grants says they're forward guidance dependent not data dependent um it's a problem because once you do forward guidance you eliminate your optionality yeah and I think Nikolai you and I being in this business we know we have to change our mind when we're wrong yeah this fed has shown over and over again that they think if they change their mind they're losing credibility so it makes them have their hands tied behind their back I'm wrong all the time I think my record is mainly because when I'm wrong I changed my mind not that I'm always right I'm certainly not forward guidance seems to tie them into positions where and eliminate flexibility they need how big</p>
      <p>a problem is the budget deficit as a practitioner it's something I can't be obsessed with on a 3 to six Monon basis as an American it's something I'm really obsessed with because debt to GDP can't go up forever and to me we have a reckoning but I don't know how the time when that's going to take place I will say that because the reserve currency we've been permitted to engage in behavior that say the Brits couldn't have behaved in there's a new term I have getting LZ trust we haven't been LZ trust because we are the reserve currency even though if you look at everything we're doing it's much more radical than the Brits were doing yeah um what's that old saying how do you go bankrupt slowly and then suddenly running deficits with full employment at basically at 7% of GDP is a recipe that can't last forever one of the reasons we haven't paid for it is in Co the entire private sector</p>
      <p>80% of individuals refinance their mortgages so the average mortgage rate is still under 4% even though at the margin it got to 8% corporations termed out their debt that stuff rolls over in 25 and 26 if we're going to have a problem it's probably more like late 25 early 26 but you just don't know so and what is it that can create this kind of trust moment where people suddenly change their mind in terms of the price they want to have to lend money to it could it could be a failed auction it could be If the Fed is wrong about inflation and it turns back up again because they're easing Financial conditions into a melt up um if they were to have to start increasing interest rates again which is why I think they should be so cautious about their optionality um now that they've forward guided to a series of cuts that could cause it um my best guess would be a failed auction but honestly it could be</p>
      <p>6 months it could be six years I I just don't know so he rat start to go up how high can they go well that's a great question because right now the 10 year I guess it's around 4 and a half it can go to nominal GDP so let's say inflation went to four 4 and A2 and real growth was 2 and a half or three 10 years AG go to six or seven I'm not predicting that but that would be consistent if things if inflation did turn back up again and the economy wasn't weakening I think you could get there it's interesting that's what happened in the 70 the bond market didn't really respond until we went back up from like 3 to 12 and then it it responded in Spades again I'm not predicting this but I'm as a practitioner I'm very open-minded to it and I've got a it's like on my radar well you say you make the most money from uh from fed mistakes so is this the way you are positioned now I'm short ponds I'm not like mega short I I</p>
      <p>actually had good timing for once I shorted them literally the day the FED cut um it's been kind of an easy ride since then I should have been much bigger now that they move so much I'm a little worried about um if anything being too big but yeah no that's the way I'm positioned if I thought what we are talking about was happening and I don't see a sign of it yet I'm just open-minded to it I would be much bigger I'm like 25% naav short uh 10e equivalent moving on to the stock market uh the leadership is very narrow it's led by not so many stocks just how do you read this narrow leadership um it's never been great but the leadership's not as narrow as it was last April so you're starting to get some broadening out the financials are doing better it's not great we've never had a bare Market start without the leadership narrowing and it's narrowing enough that you're starting to get toward a necessary condition being</p>
      <p>satisfied but it's early but it's it's a it's a yellow light it's not a red light that's how I read it so how do you think the tech sector will develop what kind of science are you seeing there the AI boom is going unabated Nikolai the I think the private sector just sees it as an existential threat to their business if they don't um spend money on it because if they don't spend money on it and their competitors do and their competitors are right they're going to have a big big competitive problem and of course the hyperscalers they're all in and their demand is just continuing so look you've got very rich prices in the tech sector stuff like apple selling I know 25 or 30 times earnings it's certainly not growing at 25 or 30% but we don't have that much exposure to the tech sector and we're not short it so not really involved cuz but you were very early into it yeah what um how do you spot</p>
      <p>these early Trends what is said that you look at honestly uh I've got young really good analysts here yeah a lot of people have a lot of young analysts who are who are on top of things and they started um we noticed about three or four years ago that the kids that go to Stanford and MIT the engineers were shifting from crypto to AI that was the first signed then my my young Partners started talking more and more about AI uh I asked them how to play it they mentioned a company called Nvidia which I thought was a gaming company I hadn't done work on in a long time um I bought a pretty good chunk of it and then like a month later chaty PT happened it was just total luck I had no idea caty p but the AI drum around here was big enough and the stock was down I think from 400 to 150 or something so</p>
      <p>that's how I got started in it once we invest in something like that then we really start to dig deeper and then there was a whole chain of things we knew it would affect power we knew it would affect uranium we just went through the whole chain and it was a pretty easy Trend to spot not not unlike um the cloud was the you know these things come in waves M but AI the question with AI now that I'm wrestling with and the reason our exposure is really neither long nor short is how to play it because we started with pix and shovels which is Invidia and to some extent um Microsoft but now we're seeing just massive amounts of capital being spent by these modelers and if AI is for real and I think it is they're all going to give you the same answer so we're going to have four or five companies will spent</p>
      <p>masses amounts of capital but I don't see it as a win or take all model on the other hand I think there applications um that I haven't even thought of and nobody's thought of they're going to spring up I mean who would have thought of Uber or Facebook when the internet started so we're very bullish on AI but we're not bullish currently on exactly where we're supposed to be and how to play it aggressively not unlike the internet in 2201 you could have believed in the internet not been exposed and then got your exposure on a more timely basis or I could just be wrong which is wouldn't be that unusual but you were also early into the anti-obesity drug producers oh that was easy I mean I don't know what it's like in Norway but in America yeah if you go to Disney World everything and if you know the American psyche if you know an American they got a way to lose weight without doing any</p>
      <p>work and uh I I knew the drug worked early on just because we were exposed to it but I and then when I heard if you get off the drug you gain the weight back then I knew it was sort of a razor blade business cuz people would have to say on the drug yeah but you say it's C but I mean hey it's not like you're the only one who is walking around around in Disneyland and looking at these kind of things right so but you you actually you actually act on your Intuition or your all the data that's in front of you I do but it's it's you know it's not all Brilliance I I I bought Nvidia very well but I sold it eight or 900 right when the party was really getting going and I sold my Lily in the high 700s granted had a had a nice profit but yeah I look for for big trends I'm not about guy that holds for 20 years but I look for two to four years stuff and both fit into that category and frankly we're looking now for AI applications that might not have been recognized yet I think I'm on the board</p>
      <p>of memal slone ketering have been for almost 30 years and the applications in cancer are unreal and just FYI the memorial slone cing is the leading cancer hospital in the world yes and they have a lot of money in the endowment partly because you are on the board or the investment committee well they have a lot of money in their D and I wouldn't say partly because I'm on the board but thank you now um when we last met you mentioned the concept of buy first analyze later tell me about that yeah Soros used to call it invest and invest and then investigate I think I just gave a classic example I didn't know that much about Nvidia I just knew that Ai and I had some people here tell me how to play it so we bought Invidia and then we we were in the process of doing a lot more work and then chat GPT tap and but I've always had the view that markets are smart they're fast and they're getting much more so with with all the communication and the technology we have today and that if I hear a concept and I</p>
      <p>like it uh if I wait and spend two or three months analyzing it I may miss big part of the move and then psychologically be paralyzed it's hard to buy a stock you're looking at at 100 it's 160 even if it's going to 400 somehow your your head is screwed up and you're waiting for the pullback so we will we will buy something a meaningful position but not Earth shaking and then really do the work and if I think we made a mistake I'll sell it and if I don't think we made a mistake We'll add to it if if we have to yeah no I I I happen to have worked exactly the same way uh in my life it it really focuses in your your work and your efforts your thinking but have you always believed in your own pattern recognition yes when I started in the business I got promoted too early so before I had really learned the nuts and bolts of the analysis to the extent that I should have I was promoted to to a to a leadership</p>
      <p>position and I had to rely a lot on charts and I had to rely a lot on intuition but I found it's not that hard if if you're dealing with a psychical company and they're losing money or they're not profitable and everybody in their industry is shutting capacity down it doesn't take a rocket scientist to try and envision 18 to 24 months out if nobody's add in capacity they may not be losing money anymore they might be making a lot of money I have found it's very important never to invest in the present always try and envision the situation as you see it in 18 to 24 months and then see if if you feel things would be differently than they are now would security prices reflect that I think that's probably the biggest mistake investors make is they invest in the present rather than forward looking and looking where the Puck's going instead of where the puck is yeah now um a few people believe in other people's</p>
      <p>gutfield did Soros believe in your gutfield or did you have to show him analysis Soros and I had a rocky start I I I went there I had had some uh significant success running public funds at dfus and he told me I was his successor but I don't really think his mind was completely made up when I got there and and the first 6 months were quite Rocky because it wasn't clear who was in charge um frankly we're both trading badly and I was flying to Pittsburgh cuz I still had Duane I was running both and um when I got off the airplane I think we had payones back then we didn't have cell phones and uh the head Trader there told me he had told out sold out my bond position so I probably had a higher opinion of myself at the time that I should have I was young and I had always been in charge so I was quite upset and uh basically</p>
      <p>uh expressed extreme displeasure and he said we'll talk about it when you come back to New York um implied that I I wanted to quit and he said that uh maybe there were too many cooks in the kitchen and he was going to Eastern Europe for four or five years he'd be out of touch and then he'd find out whether he had been in my hair or if I really was incompetent that's that's sort of the way he talks the way we think except he actually says it and luckily for me while while he was gone the Bur Wall came down I invested in the deut mark but I think it was lucky for both of us I went on like the best run I've had before or since for like four years so he kept seeing the results so I think he trusted my intuition only because the record started that way do you trust the intuition of your colleagues now I trust their analysis they're they're so much deeper and</p>
      <p>better at analysis than I was um but I can see the intuition developing that uh I'm I'm probably as bullish on the talent the equity talent in my firm as I've been in 45 years so I guess that's that's an ner of yes but partly uh brain partly analytics and then partly intuition they're not as intuitive as I am because it'll have to be I was sort of forced to be intuitive because I don't I never acquire their analytical skills you mentioned some examples of where you had sold um a bit early do you do you generally sell early no I mean embarrassingly I I did an interview on Nvidia I think it was like 370 or something and I said this is one we're probably going to own for a few years but I didn't think it was going to go to 900 in a year uh and to over a$2 trillion market cap I think it started like 100 billion or 150 billion it was</p>
      <p>something crazy um so no I don't necessarily sell early I'm a technician so I usually wait for Tops um Nvidia had no top I just thought um what does that just want to explain what does it mean to have a top a top is something the rate of change of it's going up changes and it tends to flatten out for quite some time the trick is in the technical world that could end up being a bull flag where it just Consolidated for a bit and then did a new leg or it could be a top where that was it that was it and how do you know which is which you don't you have an opinion and um you express it and sometimes you're right and sometimes you're wrong with Nvidia um there was no top but I just I've I've analyzed the semiconductors industry not particularly well but since the 1970s and it's a cycal industry m and I knew Nvidia had staying power and was</p>
      <p>they had 4,000 software Engineers so it wasn't just Hardware you know they have a Cuda this thing called cuda software that they do to to make their gpus but I just thought once it went through two trillion this is just too much and worst case it'll have a big correction I'll get another chance and of course I didn't get another chance oh you may yes I may you think you will uh I don't know from this price I assume I will or would have bought it back I don't mind buying something back higher than I would I don't like it but I'm perfectly willing to buy something back higher than I sold it some people can't get themselves do it oh I can I'm the one thing I'm strong on is I'm not emotional but um you never had a down a no stupid question why is that important no good reason I think it's it's important because other people talk about it and uh my investors loved it one ah had of investors because um you know they have this stuff in our industry you know called risk weighted</p>
      <p>return I'm not big on that but I will say it's a stressful job and there's less stress if you don't have big draw Downs I have had significant draw Downs in inner year so part of the down year is just luck what does a draw down do to you I get uh anxious upset uh you get upet even though it's only your money yes yeah I'm just um I'm a very competitive person even if it's just my own money I I wish I wasn't but I am and uh it's probably one of the reasons my results are as good as they are but I prefer myself not to be um it's a bit of a sickness but it works for me who do you compete against I compete against what I would call the opportunity set and if there was a great opportunity set that year and I missed it um I'm disappointed in my myself like if I'm up 20 and I think I should have been up 50 I'm disappointed in myself if the opportunity set was basically to be</p>
      <p>up 10 or 15 and an up 20 I'm thrilled I mean the good the good thing about being an investor is always a good reason to hit yourself in a head right I don't know if that's a good thing about our business but it's it's probably the bad thing about our business and for some reason I like to hit myself in the head I always measure from the top but you um are quick at selling your losers what's the key to that if the reason I bought a stock is no longer the case I don't care what I paid for it and if I bought it at 60 and it's 50 because the markets discovered the problem before me I have I have no emotion whatsoever um Soros was the same way I didn't really learn it from him but it was certainly reinforced like after a while Nikolai you all so develop enough confidence that you're not afraid to clean the slate and start over cuz you have the confidence that you'll be successful again and you're not going to sit there in a lazy position that you're not that</p>
      <p>sure about anymore just clean house and if you've been doing it for decades and it's worked you kind of have the confidence to take a loss and not worry about it too much once I'm out I'm out you said you don't have feelings what do you what do you mean by that did I say don't have feelings I have a lot of feelings you mean about taking losses yeah just what I mean by that is I think one of the reasons charts work we have the reason there's support and there's um there's resistance is the resistance is a bunch of people that bought it at 60 and it went down and they've been waiting for three or four years for it to get back to 60 while they could have been in something else that was going up the whole time um I just don't care what I paid for a stock it's absolutely irrelevant uh in terms of my investment process going forward now this uh combination of being on the one hand stubborn but other hand being able to change your mind it's pretty rare I'm told it is yeah I told by my friends and other</p>
      <p>investors that I'm entirely unemotional and like yes I am told it's rare is that the key to your success you think one of them I I think I think it's I think it's a big part of it I think again um being being open-minded and having humility the only reason you can change your mind is if you're not arrogant about a position has mattered I think I had some great mentors the one in Pittsburgh and then Soros in terms of sizing and I think I learned some lessons very early on uh concentration not to be afraid of concentration that that's a big reason for my success and probably the other big reason was sort of self-taught is being willing to go into other asset categories and if you're going to concentrate it's better to have five buckets to plan than to plan one so I was brought up in the equity Market but</p>
      <p>sometimes the risk reward in the equity Market is not that clear when it actually is clear clearing the bond market or the currency markets and it's a coincidence you asked about never h a down year part of it is the most action in bonds and currencies tends to happen in bare markets and Equity markets so you can put the put the equities in the drawer for a while and just concentrate in those markets I think that's been a huge part of my successes is it gives you the discipline not to play in areas that you don't have a lot of conviction in because if you got credit to play in if you got Commodities to play in currencies or bonds you can usually find something that you think there's a great risk award in it's also they tend to be more liquid than Equity markets so to our earlier conversation you can change your mind when you're wrong what do you learn about siing from Source I don't know whether you know about do you know baseball at all or would your listen</p>
      <p>about I don't play it but uh when I went to Soros I thought I would learn what would make de Mark go up in the end go up and modestly I found I was better at that than him um in baseball terms I have a I had a very high batting average he had a much higher slugging percentage um so what I learned from Soros is when you have conviction you should bet really big I know your listeners have probably heard it before but I but probably the best illustration is the pound yeah so what happened so let's go back so you are in the office what's happening in the UK so I'm in the office in New York and Scott bessent um who was a partner of mine in Europe mainly trade the European area he's in London and he tells me the London housing market is in big trouble and the British economy is in trouble because like most Anglo sex and economies at the time it's very much driven by housing and so forth Just P it</p>
      <p>out a bit so your office are you like overlooking Central Park uh I'm not overlooking Central Park but I'm near it I I'm in the Soros office on 32nd Floor but it's okay it's not a corner office it's nothing big fail see and the UK economy is going down the toilet we think the U econom is going down but I need to take you back about 3 years when the Berlin Wall cam comes down it'll probably save me my job cuz I probably would have been fir at Soros 6 months after he went to Eastern Europe had the Berlin wallnut come down but um the de Mark went down for two days dramatically because the theory in the market was the osmark which was the East German currency was going to pollute the deut Mark I knew German history and knew they were obsessed with inflation because the viar Republic and then that led to Hitler and so forth and so on so I knew the Germans were absolutely obsessed with inflation I knew that all bringing all these East</p>
      <p>Germans into the labor Supply was going to cause a boom in the economy so we were very bullish on the overall German economy and we were very convinced that there is no way the bundes bank would let inflation so we're very convinced it would be accompanied by tight monetary policy so we had shorted the Italian L successfully um during that per period so when the when Scott called me we were already sort of on this deark journey we've been for a few years and the British econom is going down and new currencies are linked so it was a peg right it was a peg so um I called and asked how much it would cost me to Short the pound versus the deut mark for six months it was a half a percent I think the fund was around 7 and a half billion at the time Quantum fund and I decided to do an invest and</p>
      <p>then investigate position so I did a billion and a half or like 20 25% of the fund short the pound long the deut mark figuring I'd probably lose a half per because it's a Peg and it won't break within 6 months but I wanted the position on Fast Forward probably about five or six weeks the day I believe was September 15th not that I would remember um I read the financial times and the head of the bunis bank now I'm sure I'm age but I'm pretty sure it was te Meer has written an editorial in the financial times basically in more proper language but he's basically saying that the deark and the pound should no longer be linked so I decide to take Duan and the quantum fund to 100% long the deark short the pound because it's still a half a perc unbelievably now you're going to hear vintage Soros so he</p>
      <p>happens to be in New York at the time which he wasn't always I go into his office and I explain to him why I'm going to 100% And he had a rather large personal account that's how we kept each other out of each other's hair he traded that and you know it was 90 90 95% overlap told him why I was doing this and he had this um unpleasant puzzled look on his face when I'm telling him my thesis that this one economy is booming and they need higher rates this other economy is falling apart they need lower rates that's these two currencies shouldn't be linked and I'm thinking what does he not understand about this because this guy pretty much understood everything and he says uh look this is uh this is a one-way bet they come along very very rarely it's ridiculous doing 100% we should put 200% of the fund in this trade so there you have it so that means</p>
      <p>that you borrow money in the bank and double up yeah on a $7.5 billion fund he thought we should have $15 billion short the pound long the deark um it turns out we never got there but it shows the way the man thinks I saw it over and over again because you once you were trading the thing happened yeah unfortunately we had a we had a pretty strong reputation and when I started selling it that night I noticed a lot of other hedge funds started selling at the gossip community and the currency markets and by midnight to 1:00 the Fords had blown out they'd started they at a half a percent they were like 6 or 7% and it basically wasn't trading after 1:00 in the morning then the British raised rates I think from 6 to 9 to try and stop the bleeding and then they went to 12 I knew it was over but the forward to rout so much didn't matter and it was it was done by</p>
      <p>noon the next day and you were sitting at your desk looking at the royter screen yes or whatever the screen at the time was we only got 7 and a half billion done ironically well I have to had it not been for Soros I probably would have not got to the 7 and a half cuz you know intending to do 15 I was in a bigger hurry so what did you feel when when he broke there was a lot of adrenaline um it was exciting I didn't feel bad because I thought the British economy needed it I was gratified years later when they changed it from black Wednesday to White Wednesday then I went into action after it broke because the guilts were down two points which I thought was ridiculous British needed lower rates there's some theory in the Academia that if you have a weak currency your interest rates have to go up so I bought guilts I bought British stocks there was a whole because what happened was that the currency depreciated and it was good for exports right so the stocks went up afterwards the stocks went up the guilts went up because they needed lower rates</p>
      <p>and you know they'd been held artificially high so there was all kinds of other stuff I did around it uh which is kind of the way I trade you get a theme and then you look at the concentric circles or the or The Dominoes that fall because of a theme and but the point was with Soros if he really believe something the position could be never be big enough yeah particularly if it's in a liquid market and I learned from him I like to play the turn maybe my ego in in a in a big turn in something he was perfectly happy to play from the third to the sixth inning if we go back to baseball terms of it's a nine inning game he was perfectly happy to play the third to sixth inning when there was more certainty on much greater leverage he had more courage than I did in terms of sizing positions I don't think it totally rubbed off on me but it certainly helped and it it was a huge learning experience I think the major thing I learned with him is it's not whether you're right or wrong it's how</p>
      <p>much you make when you're right and how much you lose when you're wrong and that's what he was probably as good as anybody who's ever been at Stan um many people have heard about the pound but um not many people know that you also did the Swedish Groner yes um my memory's a little less clear on that one as to the reasoning but it was just another another victim of the deark yeah um I assume there was some kind of Divergence between the two economies and and there was a peg that I thought was inappropriate and it turned out yeah that worked out so you took that Peg too but you took another Peg too because I thought you were also involved with the tibot yeah the tibot was easy they they um but but nobody knows about this right no I think um Sebastian Malby wrote a book called more money than God there's a whole chapter on the tibot that was not on the Swedish croner no the Swedish croner no no I prefer nobody knew any of this stuff but well we need to get it</p>
      <p>right for the history books I'm happy to talk about it 25 years later any trades you regret not making oh there's there's trades I regret not making um constantly I'd say one of the biggest mistakes I made was having predicted the inflation really early and feeling so strongly about it I wrote a piece in the Wall Street Journal with my partner Christian broa in the spring of 21 I had a mass of short for me in two years um sort of like we just talked about with the pound it was a one-way bet they were 15 basis points and I was so measured by where they'd win where they'd been I took most of them off at like 150 basis points it seemed like a great win from 15 to basis point to 150 but as you know they went to 500 I regret deeply not holding that position there's probably 30 others but I prefer</p>
      <p>to forget my mistakes do you think machines can take the place of humans when it comes to investing no I don't but I think they can work um as a CO co-pilot and the combination can beat anything a mere human could be I'm lucky enough to have known Gary caspro for a long time I'm co-founder of the casprov chess Foundation um for no good reason I I I can hardly play chess my 9-year-old daughter was beating me that's how I started with Gary but um he was probably one of the first guys to use machines to train himself and work with them I could see the same thing happening with money management so I don't think the pure machines they'll make money because they have a disciplined process and there's math but I think if you could find an intuitive investor who's using Ai and other things to supplement I think that</p>
      <p>would probably be the top investor in the world not a machine now you took um sabatical in 200000 yeah what was the reason behind that it's a it's a painful but really fun story um it really it really starts in 1998 well no it starts in the spring of 1999 I shorted I think it was 11 or 12 internet stocks not the leaders like aoi or Yahoo but the also rans and I I believe the position was like $200 million and in like four weeks I had lost like $600 million so it was the first time I'd ever had a big draw down I was down like 16 or 7% in the spring of 99 I then pivoted and realized that green span e because</p>
      <p>of the agent financial crisis while our economy was strong and we had the internet and all this behind it I went out and hired um a couple of young managers to buy tech stocks that I didn't know how to spell they had their own little accounts and like I would plow in on top of their positions and we ended up the year I think something like 42 net or something after being in this deole because you know I rode this crazy n sck wave in 99 so then uh in January I just said this is ridiculous and um I sold out all my tech Holdings like I can't remember it was like they had grown to like $ billion dollar or it was it was enormous for that period of time and I actually went and told Soros why I had sold them out and next thing that happens the two little satellites inside they don't sell</p>
      <p>out they're gamblers I don't really care cuz quantum's huge and they're this little thing they're not going to affect the performance that much but Nikolai they're making like four to 5% a day I mean the market is still roaring going into March and I'm uh I'm watching this and I'm getting really annoyed with myself that I'm not I'm not still in this trade and then uh around early March I can't take it anymore and I told you earlier I'm not emotional this was this was a real emotional really dumb move um I buy everything back I think I missed the top by about an hour so I buy back all these tech stocks and within a week I know I'm dead and Quantum goes from like up 14% to up 1% in a week and I go in and I now I've already</p>
      <p>been through the trauma of the spring before I recovered from it but it it had a big effect on me the the stress I had young kids you know and it's like a repeat of the year before so I go into Soros and I tell them two things a I'm getting out of all this stuff B uh I'm quitting um we can't tell anybody cuz I got I got to liquidate this portfolio but the NASDAQ is in the beginning wave of a Down 90% move and you can't get out so by the time I get out takes a few weeks the fund is down like 177% and duain is down 177% and uh I'm just exhausted I've been running this high-profile fund for 12 years so I sell everything out everything of duaine send my investors a letter and say uh I'm going on a sabatical I don't</p>
      <p>know whether I'm coming back or not you can take all your money out but if you take your money out if I decide to come back I can't guarantee I'll let you back in I think I had like 200 clients one of them pulled their money I remember who it was but they'll remain anonymous for now so I I shut everything down I go to Africa with my wife and kids and the best thing I did is during the summer I refused to expose myself in any way to something that would tell me where the markets were so I'm not allowed to watch TV I'm not allowed to see the Wall Street Journal prices nothing so I come back in labor day I think my wife couldn't have handled me being around uh once the kids go back to school uh sort of humor maybe not uh so I come back and it's remarkable because the S&P has rallied back almost</p>
      <p>to the high the nasdaq's retrace about 85% of the decline but the dollar is up interest rates are up and oil is up three death nails for markets if you look at history so I then start calling all my clients who are basically small businessmen they're not fancy institutions and all their businesses are terrible so then I call Ed Heyman and I say he Equity strategists microeconomist yeah he's probably was the number one institutional guy whatever that rating Institutional Investor Economist and um I say this is very odd and I've been out of touch dollars up blah blah blah blah and uh two days later in his daily missive he has regression analysis and it says um it's 50% I think currency 25% oil and 25% interest rates and it looks one year</p>
      <p>forward and it predicts earnings and it's predicting that earnings are going to decline 36% the next year and the Wall Street consensuses are going to go up 18% so combination of that listening to my clients the fact that Greenspan got a tightening directive on which I think is inappropriate I start buying all these treasuries and the market doesn't go my way but all the information keeps going so I keep buying more and more and more and more so now I have a 350% tenure equivalent in the fund and then I get lucky with the gore Bush Fiasco economy falls apart I end up making 40% in the fourth quarter so I had I had written the year off I I when I came back I'm down 18 I assume okay at least I got don't have to worry about this anymore i' finally going to have it down year and it's like the best quarter</p>
      <p>I ever had and to this day if I had stayed managing money I think I'd been tied of knots and there's no way I would make that trade it was the fact that I was a raid for four months had a clean slate had a clear head and just looked at the New Evidence so it was a very very very horrible beginning and a very lucky ending now you don't take um four months off very often uh you work very hard when do you wake up in the morning 4 4 in the morning yeah what do you do uh I you have you have an an office at home right yeah yeah I immediately go to the Bloomberg and 4:00 you do you make a cup of coffee before you go to Bloomberg or straight to Bloomberg yes no yeah I make a cup of coffee I go up I don't shower yet check all the markets read the journal skim the financial times skim the New York Times check like all the emails overnight when I say check I mean skim them for the important ones then it's</p>
      <p>probably uh 5:15 or 5:30 take a shower go to work start all over again when you go to bed uh usually around 8:30 qu or 9 as soon as I see Japan what's happening you basically live according to financial markets yes uh my mother-in-law said a long time ago I'm an idiot savant she thought she was joking but she's correct it's the only thing I'm really good at I really enjoy it keeps me young I'm dealing with brilliant young people here as analysts but also I forc to read the newspaper and forc to learn about these waves and uh keeps me stimulated I love it now you are 71 right yes and you will continue until you until you die you think yes hopefully it won't be tonight no I think probably not I do um s last thing we got 10 thousands of young people here now they want to be like you make a lot of money be successful in financial markets what should they be doing how should they enter what what should they think about</p>
      <p>first of all if they're going in it for the money they should go elsewhere yeah there's too many people in the business like me that just love the game and the passion for reasons I just articulated and they're not going to be to out work the people that are passionate in the game and it's not a fun game if you're losing it's horrible I just told you and the how I respond to draw Downs so but if they have a passion for it if I was a young person I would not get an MBA I'd go find a mentor and if they didn't want me I would just relentlessly bug the hell out of them which a couple of have done with me until they finally accepted me to go and work for them learn what I could from them if they still like the business just keep trying to grow your knowledge base I would say an analyst skill set in our business is completely different than a portfolio manager skill set once in a while you'll get an overlap but I</p>
      <p>would be careful if they really love the the analyst part which is where we all start of thinking they have to become a portfolio manager I've seen it ruin people's lives who weren't built for trigger pulling so they should be open-minded I got in the business because I wanted intellectual stimulation and you're going to get plenty in either one but that would be that would be my advice to them and be open-minded stand this been a an epic conversation thanks Nikolai I probably said more than I should have you said exact we get in too much trouble thank you [Music]</p>

      <div class="transcript-body">
      <p>this man made more than a billion dollars last year in a single week that's right a single week that bet was his event has been available for the last ten years and it only paid off at that particular moment then he spent the next few months giving it away sometimes a hundred million dollars at a time what is always said with the mostess money in the West extended in the East week George Soros and find out what drives one of the world's most successful investors this program was made possible by a grant from MetLife with over 120 years experience in financial management sounds there certainly is I was very Sun suddenly did that one needs to look into George Soros is a man of many paradoxes</p>
      <p>he's a world-class speculator who sounds and write like an Oxford philosophy professor it certainly doesn't sound like a Wall Street fund manager last year he gave away more than a hundred million dollars in Russia yet he thinks it may be too late to stop Russia from sliding into chaos he's an expert he in Soviet minorities I spoke with George Soros last fall after his great currency coup when he made a billion dollars almost overnight but the more I heard about his recent philanthropy the more I wanted to talk to him again I wanted to find out what kind of man would stake more than his entire fortune against the Bank of England and then give away so much of the winnings they call it black Wednesday the day</p>
      <p>that the British pound fell out of the European exchange rate system in London they blamed the man who was betting against the Bank of England and who'd walked off with over a billion dollars in winnings George Soros was declared a villain by the British tabloids and a financial genius by many others did you really bet more than your entire personal fortune on this trade because all the money in my funds was invested in the pound short against the dollar we had about seven billion dollars invested in and there was no way the fund could cover if we lost all seven billion dollars so you personally were liable for absolutely everything you had right what finally triggered pulling the trigger on that bet</p>
      <p>well the trigger was a statement by the President of the British Bundesbank Schlesinger that he would prefer to see the Italian lira devalue without mentioning the pound at all so I figured this was certainly a message that he did not have the same feelings towards the pound that he had towards the lira, the trigger really came from Schlesinger Yes sounds like a man who has studied Europe who has great context to knows how these central bankers think I mean I I think I understand how how central banks fit into the political process pretty well when the British finance ministers were caught off guard by the collapse of the</p>
      <p>pound the BBC was there the decision is made the pound will leave the ERM to recover when the dust settled George Soros was a billion dollars richer many people have called you a villain for this trade what do you think about that well I think that as a market participant I am acting in a way to make money that is my way of making a living and I think that a world where you can make money by speculating against the Central Bank has grave defects it needs to be improved but I don't think I'm the one to be blamed I'm just following the rules that everybody else is following I'm not</p>
      <p>of the world to be sure George Soros's worldview was formed as a teenager during the Second World War when all the usual rules of normal life were suddenly fractured it really started in 1944 when Henry was occupied by Germans and me being Jewish I was in danger of life his father a prominent Budapest attorney who had lived through the Russian Revolution understood the art of survival when the Germans came in he said this is a lawless occupation the normal rules don't apply you have to forget how you behave in a normal society this is an abnormal situation and he arranged for all of us to have false papers everybody</p>
      <p>had a different arrangement I was adopted by an official of the Minister of Agriculture whose job was to take over Jewish properties so I actually went with him and we took possession of these large estates that was my identity so it's a strange very strange life for everything I was 14 years old at the time George you've written the second world war gave me a lesson I've never forgotten which was the value of being ahead of the curve what do you mean by that it's being ahead of the curve it's being prepared for change anticipating change trying to anticipate being prepared to respond to it and recognizing what is happening if you can recognize what is happening and be ahead of it you actually profit from the situation I thought Soros was describing</p>
      <p>a game of skill at which he was better than most but I was wrong if that's the lesson you took what is the skill or the game that you took away from 1944 what is the skill at which you excel at the game well I think the game is that you recognize that prevailing trends or prevailing valuations are based on a misconception and that that misconception is going to be revealed and there will be a move from one state of misconception to a different valuation and then there's a discontinuity in the first you have to recognize it and you have to respond to it can you give me an example you mean what am I talking</p>
      <p>about yes you got it precisely right what are you talking about I'm talking about looking at the world as a great historical development history is being made history is not just a past that we look at it's something that is being made and recognizing this was the very first lesson that Soros learned from his father in 1944 even as a fourteen year old he understood the difference between ordinary life and history being made the current situation in Europe for instance is such a period of far-reaching historical change the collapse of the Soviet empire the the formation of the new world order is some kind of a historical</p>
      <p>event you recognize that it's a historical event and you prepare yourself for the kind of changes that it can cause how do you recognize when something is a historical event by reading your books it tells you one thing about book learning and actually doing it another to learn from books and experience I mean from experience I think that what you learned from books is sort of the groundwork from experience you develop your skills and I was quite good at anticipating events at a very young age I was 14 when I was good at it so what did you learn what did you do that trained you in that skill to anticipate events I was playing a game where my life was at stake and I did survive so I obviously I survived</p>
      <p>reversed so it was a boom past a kind of sequence and I think that I understood it reasonably well and the same thing would work on the downside and the depression is there a Great Depression anywhere in the world today that has to be reversed I think that we are in a Great Depression now in the world I think that I think the death that we are in condition is very similar to what prevailed in the 1930s why I think that for instance for the first time since the Second World War they say prices are actually falling in engineering the country like Japan for instance that is something that hasn't happened since the 1930s this small trading room in New York Soros trades currency stocks and bonds around the world but looking for the unexpected on a global scale it's not an easy job Saros made one of his biggest mistakes in his own backyard you wrote</p>
      <p>that you saw the crash coming in the late 80s and 87 and yet you got caught like everyone else how do you explain that I made a very big mistake in 1987 based on a theory of mine that the crash when it came was going to occur in Japan first and then spread around the world it actually occurred first in the United States and spread around the world and I was on the wrong end in both markets and then there was also a market in between which was the currency market where I was caught and I took a beating on on all three so it was 1987 probably your worst year well no in a way 1981 was worse because I made</p>
      <p>less money but I lost a bigger percentage of the money that I had Soros now manages five billion dollars in investments and the Quantum Fund has consistently generated between 30 and 40 percent return compounded annually his colleague Stan Druckenmiller who runs the fund with him says that Soros likes to take a big position let it run and then get out of the way quickly when things go wrong we talked about the 1992 British pound trade how soon after could you tell that it was a big winner and why did you decide to get out after two weeks I knew it was a big winner immediately because I knew that the kind it was clear that Britain was going to leave the ERM so we knew that was the case and it was a question of how high will the pound go so it was something that we just watched on a day by day basis and that's where I have to give Druckenmiller a lot of credit because he rode that one magnificently</p>

      <p>[Applause] okay now I actually want to start with you not with the presidential elections we'll get there but I do want to start with you on the U.S debt limit because this is something where we're out of the clear on the surface but you have been very very clear you've recently revived a presentation you did 10 years ago with students at USC and you've told them that the economic storm that's Brewing from U.S spending is worse than you had imagined I also want to bring up on the screen some of the charts that you showed them kind of the pace of entitlement spending in the United States I want to ask you what are the consequences now that we're kind of past the initial pains in Washington what is the country and the economy and investors what are they ignoring thanks chanoli nice to be here um I don't think the entitlement situation is something</p>
      <p>you should be trading on in the next three to six months what I've been focused on actually for over a decade is the long-term picture and the long-term implications so the last thing you should do is run out of this conference after I say something about entitlements and think there's a trade to be made on it uh that's not that's not the situation okay I need to go back a little bit but um way back in the 90s somebody sent me a paper outlining how the birth rate in the 50s was so high and it had shrunk and that we're going to have this demographic storm hit sometime in the 2020s and you could pretty much map it because the demographics of public information this was on top of the fact that since Medicare and Medicaid joined Social Security as entitlements in the 60s the seniors share of government spending had already grown</p>
      <p>dramatically safe from 30 to 58 percent of outlays during that time and I was concerned way back then when that sometime the 2020s sort of like the Pig and the python when when the Baby Boomers became seniors already with them a high percentage of government spending your growth of seniors would be dramatic and by the time I was looking at it the the birth rate for the current generation was below two so you're going to have this huge increase in seniors at the same time that you had a reduction in workers in the way our system works you take the taxes of current workers to pay for seniors um it really looked bad to me in around 2011 or 2012 so much so that I thought I go out and see if I could move the needle on this issue I was really successful the only thing Donald Trump</p>
      <p>and Hillary Clinton agreed on was that you shouldn't touch entitlements in other words nobody listened to me um it's um it was a tough situation then and looking out it was really scary but when you just use the term worse than I ever imagined what I didn't know is the next 10 years we were just going to have a proliferation of government debt even outside of outside of entitlements and then when covet hit it was just sort of the cherry on top it's it's hard to believe looking back during those 10 years with interest rates near zero you had two big economic booms one going into 18 under Donald Trump supposedly a republican uh supposedly with the party that cared a lot about spending and with three and a half percent unemployment we had something unprecedented we had a trillion dollar deficit usually when the economy is roaring tax revenues go up in the</p>
      <p>deficit shrinks we then had a post covet boom in 2021 which was also accompanied by wild increases in in Tech and in Tech stock prices so much so that we had capital gains 600 billion dollars above the average capital gains for a year we sold 100 billion in Spectrum sales we had 10 percent nominal growth because of inflation so you might ask yourself since the last tech boom in 99 under Democratic Administration by the way we had a surplus how big was the Surplus with all these anomalies in 21 again I've LED my own question we had over a trillion dollar deficit we didn't even get to less than five percent of GDP so what I was worried about 10 years ago you now have an enormous amount of debt on top of it</p>
      <p>the zero interest rates kind of suppressed what I would say is the concern about this obviously a lot of debt you're not pay any interest on it who cares but now once the inflation hit interest rates are going to go up so the punch line I'm rambling on here more than I wanted to the punch the punch line is if you take the current situation and you ask yourself why should I actually say something else the current the debt went from saying um 20 trillion to 35 I'm sorry 15 trillion to 31 trillion over that time that debt and this is important because most people don't understand it um assumes he'll never be another Medicare or Social Security payment made 200 trillion is the present value as you've calculated for the students not me credible people Larry cutlickoff and others so if you assume we're never going to have another social security or medicare payment the debt is 31 trillion but if you did your accounting like any</p>
      <p>Corporation and you assume those payments going to be made yeah the present value is probably around 200 trillion dollars so you know I should also say that the big type is U.S exceptionalism at risk is it yeah I think it is um America is an amazing country with an amazing system and if you look at the innovation in this country just look at what's happened since 1980 we LED in the in the PC Revolution we led the development the internet we led the development of cloud we led to development mobile maybe it's not good that we let in crypto who knows um and we're obviously leading in in generative AI so we've been the leader throughout but we've also been the reserve currency and we've been eating so much Seed corn presently that I worry about the future if if you were to take economists have</p>
      <p>this only economists come up with this term it's called fiscal Gap what is fiscal Gap that's how much you would have to raise taxes today to guarantee the benefits you've promised seniors in the future it's 7.7 percent of GDP what is 7.7 percent of GDP mean to actually paying for the entitlements we promised in the future you'd have to raise all taxes 40 percent today forever or cut all spending 36 percent today forever so what what I'm looking at here is this stuff is borrowing from the future you're going to crowd out private Investments you're going to crowd out the kind of investment that made us a leader on all those kind of things but again this is a long-term worry but but the statement by both parties that entitlements are off the table it's like 70 percent of the federal</p>
      <p>budget and rising and now that interest rates have come up it's a fantasy in fact it's a lie we are definitely going to cut entitlements it's just a matter we're going to cut them today or in the future and the longer we wait the more it piles up a year or two ago um or right now the interest expense is about one or two percent of GDP it's about six percent of outlays the cbo's estimate not mine interest expense is 27 percent of outlays by 2050 and just entitlements and interest expense just though two things alone no defense no running the government no money for the disadvantage will be 117 percent of taxes by 2050 and it'll be more than all taxes by 2040. but again for investors in the room this is just stuff to worry about in the long term I like to think in the long term but for trading it doesn't impact your your original question the way you put it to</p>
      <p>the students it's the tsunami that is 10 foot out on the horizon but you know the other the other thing here is you know it's I think it's pretty safe to say you've been pretty critical of fiscal and monetary policy the question here and I want to put one more chart on the history of bubbles that you show the students as well because the question I have for you there is do you believe that there are still many shoes to drop as the Central Bank stays tight uh that's my central case um ideal in the world of of risk reward there's a 500 year history of asset bubbles well documented in a book that you had some issues with the price of time uh and basically it documents and I had already known this about the last hundred years but it's going out for 500 years every time you've had a significant asset bubble economic trouble way ahead but yeah when you had 11 years of free money</p>
      <p>um people do stupid things all you have to do is look it up there about how the stupidest is somebody paid 80 billion dollars for Dogecoin which was invented as a joke I mean that can only happen in the world of free money it also suppress people worrying about the kind of stuff I just talked about two or three minutes ago because you keep rates at zero but the fact that this was arguably the most disruptive economic period we've had since the late 1800s and there were no bankruptcies apparently they've started in the last few weeks tells me there's a lot of stuff under the hood when you go from this kind of environment the biggest broadest asset bubble ever and then your jack rates up 500 basis points in a year I think the probabilities would suggest that Silicon Valley Banks Bed Bath and Beyond they're probably the tip of the iceberg nothing's guarantee I've been wrong a lot I've been right a few times but um yeah our Central cases there's more shoes to drop particularly in addition</p>
      <p>to the asset markets economically what are you most worried about we'll definitely get to the opportunity on the fat pitches that you see on the horizon but before we even get there what starts to sink um I could see corporate profits down 20 to 30 percent normally I would say 40 or 50 in a hard Landing but this recession is so anticipated I don't think a lot of corporations are going to be caught with their pants down which is how normally lose a lot of money as you're not prepared for something that happens um commercial real estate and you know I'm not informing anybody in this room with something they don't know but office is a problem it would have been a problem anyway but but change of Lifestyle in covid makes it even bigger problem financing rates going up and I get a problem I'm worried about credit tightening the next six to nine months obviously the banks are going into an</p>
      <p>economic period that if in fact we get a recession their balance sheets are already impaired not from where they usually lose money which is loans um from the fact that the FED convinced them that they're going to keep rates to zero until 24 so they bought a bunch of treasuries yielding one or two percent and now they're carrying them at five so so their balance sheets are impaired but if we get in a recession then the real losses comes which is stuff like credit cards commercial real estate that kind of stuff so those would be my my worries um you asked me my worries that's different than my predictions I well the predictions you've been talking about I'm so tired of being a bear and being labeled there but to the bearish point of view we haven't seen it we have not seen that hard Landing yet and there's going to be many people after you today that are predicting a soft landing and so to the extent you still believe that a hard Landing is ahead of us when does it come what does it look like</p>
      <p>yeah um a lot of people because we haven't had an economic decline start yet have changed our forecast from a hard Landing soft landing and a lot of others have changed it from soft Landing to no Landing I haven't changed mine at all the fact that it hasn't happened yet doesn't change the probability if it does happen of the depth of it I mean basically 10 trillion dollars 5 trillion monetary 5 trillion fiscal was put in during covid what has happened is that created this giant giant stock of liquidity I think Jamie Diamond said a couple years ago there were two and a half trillion access demand deposits we've been working at liquidity off slowly that liquidity Interruption liquidity shrink was interrupted when Bank of Japan changed ycc they went in and they bought 400 billion dollars worth of bonds to defend their bond market very odd situation they raise</p>
      <p>rates but then liquidity exploded on it and then obviously the debt ceiling um secretary Yellen Drew down the TGA that's basically the treasury savings account from 700 billion to practically nothing last week that also ended up in non-issuance of government debt so that was a big boost of liquidity all that is set to change now actually the TJ is going to go the other way she's already stated she wants to build it back up to normal levels so you're going to have probably about 800 billion in treasuries issued between now and Year End the Fed will be continuing on with QT you've got the student loan thing which I think has kept consumption up that's all changing in September they're going to have to actually God forbid the United States somebody actually pays interest on a loan so to me the probabilities haven't changed it's been pushed out relative expectations but in no way does the fact</p>
      <p>that it hasn't started yet change the probability of whether it's going to be hard or soft I would actually argue since it's taken so long the FED has ended up with a higher terminal rate and in fact inflation gets stickier the long it stays in the system that it increases not decreases of probably of a hard Landing by the way after the 87 crash I was convinced we're going to have depression so I've been wrong before and if I'm wrong on this I'll I'll adjust but I have to weigh the probabilities and do what I do in my process and right now that's where we are and when uh I have been I think September is the first time when I was sort of a boom afraid of booming economy inflation guide to I'm more worried about growth that I am about inflation and originally I was fourth quarter of 23. I temporarily maybe lost my mind or maybe I was ripe when the Silicon Valley</p>
      <p>thing happened and got anecdotals and stuff that is traditionally LED like trucks and Retail move that up to now I think I'm probably wrong and I'm going to go back to the end of 23 but the real answer is I don't know so recession or no recession though one thing that's interesting and you included a lot of people are very encouraged by certain areas of the market particularly the AI boom there's always stuff to do we had a hard Landing in 74.75 and chemicals and oils and that stuff did great I'm sorry go ahead answer well do you think that all of AI makes it through this recession or do you think that some areas of the market particularly in AI start to look like they're in bubble territory well all of AI is not going to make it through whether we have a recession or not because they haven't separated the wheat from the traf shaft yet but I do believe um unlike crypto I think AI is real it's</p>
      <p>probably it could be as transformative as the Internet it's a huge thing and I think I've argued publicly that if Staples can go up in price in a recession why can't a company like Nvidia if they go up if they go up if their orders and earnings go up 70 percent in a hard Landing which is what I think would probably happening it's not clear that me that Nvidia goes down despite the Loft evaluation level history has proved if you do if you have very good earnings in a recession and they're sustainable if they're not the market somehow figures it out those stocks will do just fine so um we have some Longs we have some shorts and the AIs have sort of dominated the long portfolio for five or six months how do you think about and shortened this Market our shorts have been fine this year except my index shorts which have been a disaster</p>
      <p>but we always short the same way I just try and look at the current situation and then I try and think of a situation 12 to 18 months from now based on my forecast and I think if I think the security prices are going to be less um then I short them frankly I'm not sure I've ever made money if I took back the last 40 years I'm afraid to look I've never had a down year but I'm not sure I've made money in shorts I like it it's fun but you can get your head handed to you and it's a game that really only professionals and the mass against you if you're if you're dead wrong on a long you can lose a hundred percent if you're dead wrong on a short you can lose 10 times your money and in when I was at Soros I shorted 200 million dollars worth of Internet stocks in March of 99 and in three weeks covered them at a 600</p>
      <p>million dollar loss I lost 600 million dollars on a 209 investment in three weeks I was short 12 stocks they all went bankrupt every one of them don't try that at home well I mean to that to that point when you look at the AI kind of Boom here are there lessons to be learned from the.com Bubble bubble yeah uh there are lessons they're definitely lessons to be learned don't get emotional don't get crazy but I will I will say this about the AI Nvidia bottomed in October in the low 100s it's true it's 380 or 390 it's a nosebleed territory if this is a secular move if this is if this thing is real you just don't have 10 month moves that's not how it works even the dot Tom bubble lasts in the two two and a half years for many of for many of the guts of the internet it lasted four years the Cisco is the sun micros so could Nvidia go down materially in</p>
      <p>the short term from any point yes but I would be I would be surprised if I'm right on AI and the impact on it I mean it's already making the top coder seven to eight times seven to eight times more productive than they were five months ago if it's as big as I think it is Nvidia is something we're going to want to own for at least two or three years not for 10 months and maybe longer certainly the topic du jour there's another thing that a lot of investors are talking about it's the promise of China this idea and you know it's time to get your global view here because so many people rely on you for for the macro perspective The View here is that the GDP in China will expand faster than the United States and a lot of investors are kind of shaking off geopolitical tensions on the back of that theory do you see the same promise that the China Bulls are seeing I do not um I was in love with China until about six or seven years ago you go over there and the energy in Shanghai was like New York</p>
      <p>on crack I mean just it's just fantastic energy the entrepreneurs were exciting they were into it um and then Xi Jinping did his thing and if you look at China in the rise of China I think it all sort of happened you had this internal capitalist system with a bunch of people that act like crazy New Yorkers building new businesses in a dynamic economy um but he has proved he's not a capitalist he's definitely not a monopolist there's only room for one monopolist in China in his mind that's him anybody that gets their heads stuck up and I honestly think he other either either doesn't understand why China grew and succeeded the way they did or frankly he doesn't care because in terms of staying in power but I would be</p>
      <p>looking out 10 or 15 years I just don't see it I unless there's a change in power there at the top I think that's going to be a very undynamic economy it's not so much a geopolitical concern I will say this that if I'm right it makes me more fearful of military action because that's when dictators become more dangerous is when they've got a divert attention from the immediate problem so what they're doing now is very stimulative we're expecting a sugar high and some kind of robust growth there maybe for six or nine months but looking out I'm I don't I do not look at them as a big challenge in the United States in terms of economic power and growth there's equally been a lot of investor questions about the future of Japan as well how do you think about the opportunity set and how to invest well when I went to Soros Japan like set me off like a rocket ship because I I assure the Nikki at the top I had everything and then I think every</p>
      <p>trade I made like five years later on I've lost money in Japan it's been the biggest value trap in history but I will say right now I I haven't checked this but it's it's by far been the the deepest breadth and the best Market uh this year yeah our Market's up I think you said 12 but it's like seven socks and everything else is not even up that's not the case in Japan the breadth is tremendous there you have a couple things going on they look um they look like they're solving deflation plus so you're getting nominal growth they've also it's more than just talk they're really into the whole shareholder value thing and then you got a guy running monetary policy and he sounds like Jerome Powell two years ago I mean inflation's taking off there and he's saying we haven't quite achieved our golient even though he's like doubled his goal that has stated so you put all that together um for now you have a dynamic Market but given my record trading Japan now the</p>
      <p>last 15 years should do the opposite of what I sing mathematics so we're going to get there uh you know because the fiscal will overtake the the monetary pretty soon as well especially as we look forward to a 2024 election cycle in the United States and when you look at the wide range of Republican hopefuls who are either challenging or May challenge Donald Trump Nikki Haley Chris Christie Mike Pence Ron DeSantis Tim Scott Glenn youngin who has your money and who has your vote um I love Tim Scott I'd like him to be the next president whether he has the name recognition whether he's too nice a guy for this fight I don't know but um I'm not really into dividers I'd like to see the country United I think um from that party he's the one that could probably most accomplish that um I'm kind of excited about</p>
      <p>Chris Christie taking on Donald Trump the other's kind of like dance around the subject they don't even use his name I think somebody needs to hit him in the mouth with the way he hits people in their mouth and Chris Christie could be very good at that I was very disappointed the way he handled the 2016 thing for those who don't know it on National Television I said that Donald Trump had the um economic understanding of a kindergarten of the U.S economy on national television with John Kasich and then he came a year later and said I overestimated his economic standings it just just just so you were now oh not but anyway um I don't think Chris Christie can win but I'm excited that he's getting in the race because I think he can maybe expose Donald Trump and he really needs to be exposed so what do you think about some of the other candidates especially Ron DeSantis</p>
      <p>uh you know the way that he has approached corporations in Florida in particular what do you think that means for him as he enters the race I actually think until recently he did a great job in Florida if if you look at the record um he's very smart um not that broad in terms of the people around him he'd have to build that going in um but despite his intelligence it seems like his calculus is to go after the Trump voters I don't think the Trump voters care about policy I don't think they can be moved and by going after the Trump voters he's alienating the other 30 to 40 percent of the pie particularly women and others that care a lot about the social issues he's not my he's not my favorite but um frankly if he ran against Joe Biden I vote for him enthusiastically I wonder you define yourself</p>
      <p>is there anyone in the Democratic party that excites you well I'd love it if Gina raimondo would run but apparently we're going to put an 80 year old who's going on 100 on the ticket I I don't understand what the Democrats are doing I voted for two Democrats out of the last five elections I'm not like some partisan crazy person but what are they doing um so you know I don't know I don't know there doesn't seem to be anybody other than Bobby Kennedy who's willing to take him on Bobby Kennedy is a little nuts but mark my words he's going to scare this guy because when people go to the polls particularly a year from now because Joe Biden is a moving puck I wouldn't be surprised if if Bobby Kennedy doesn't get more support than any of us could imagine you know democrat or republican the kind of trajectory you pointed at at the very beginning of this higher spending no matter what no matter what scenario</p>
      <p>we're in in the next couple of years in the United States do you think investors will be facing much higher taxes eventually I'll set for a hedge yeah the only the only way out of this is I mean given what I talked about earlier taxes are going to be much higher in 20 years if it's a Republican president can they hold out for a few more years I assume so but taxes are going up it's either that or you know 30 or 40 inflation which I don't think is going to happen so before I let you go I know you won't perfectly answer me on this with a lot of specificity you've been saying I know I had any perfect answer well what is the fat pitch you've been saying that you have been kind of cautious when it comes to markets at what point do you start to get in and you start to have a conviction trade that is much bigger I think my record is as much knowing not when to play as when to play and because I deal in five or six</p>
      <p>different asset classes I've had the luxury if there's uncertainty inequities usually that's a good time for bonds and currencies they're doing crazy things when the world's blowing up so there's a lot of volatility there and I I would love to answer your question but this is the most complicated non-road map unanalyzable situation I've ever seen in terms of having a lot of confidence in an economic prediction going forward so I honestly and I hate not to answer questions I honestly don't see a fat pitch right now what I do think is given the change in liquidity giving everything I've outlined some really fat pitches are going to emerge in say the next eight to 24 months and I don't want to blow my cash and being being a horrible mental</p>
      <p>state being down eight percent making a big bet on something that I didn't have amazing conviction on when I think the road map is going to be good so um you talked to me about this interview in January I probably wouldn't have accepted it if I knew that I was going to be as messed up in the head as I am right now in June but uh I also thought it would be bad to cancel [Laughter] so I don't have a fat pitch but I hope I hope I've imported something to your audience yeah absolutely we will ask you again in eight months you said appreciate it</p>

      <div class="transcript-body">
      <p>I want to welcome in our Bloomberg Television and radio audiences to the special episode of Bloomberg Markets. Seated here with an exclusive interview with chair and CEO of Duquesne Family Office, billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller. Now stand. In 2021, you had written an opinion paper in The Wall Street Journal that said the Fed is playing with fire. And a couple weeks ago, you wrote to me and you said that you hope that the Fed is not making the same mistake that it had made in 2021, the mistake of being trapped by forward guidance. What's at stake here? Why are you so concerned? Thanks, General. It's nice to be here. In 2021, I think the Fed did a great job when we were facing a black hole and COVID in 2020. They took some very aggressive actions. One of those actions was forward guidance for they to try and settle markets got it ahead to basically a zero interest rate policy.</p>
      <p>I think it's for it was frankly for three years we were all fooled by COVID. I was two when when it first happened, we were wondering, you know, are we sinking into a black hole? But it was pretty obvious, I'd say a month or two after vaccine confirmation, which was the fall of 20, that we weren't going into a black hole. Unemployment, which I think had been around 14%, started to drop precipitously. The economy came back. We wrote the article in the spring of 21 because at this point we felt we were like booming. And it was it was everywhere. And the economy and the companies we talked to and unemployment rate everywhere. And the Fed wasn't adjusting. So they were buying, I think, 120 billion a month of securities that might have been down to 95 a month by that time period and rates were still zero. And I think had they had a clean slate, they would have never been buying bonds</p>
      <p>to that degree with what was going on in the economy. But they were trapped, in my opinion, by forward guidance. It's pretty incredible from from the point we wrote the article when it was so obvious that we even wrote about it. It was 13 months from when inflation went through 2% to when they finally raised rates. They also bought 2 trillion of bonds during that period. So I guess the reason I analogize it today and it's quite different, I had a lot of confidence then that they were wrong on inflation. The money supply was growing at 40%. As I said, the economy was booming. This one's much more nuanced. However, I'm just look at the asymmetry here. Back then you go 13 months with inflation through the target goes up to eight and a half percent and is still going on the three months and you're keeping rates at zero and you're buying bonds like crazy.</p>
      <p>And then you when you finally move, you move 25 basis points. And your rationale is we need to see the whites of inflation's eyes. And you're saying this was three or four or 5%. Okay. Today we're still quite a bit above target, depending on which measure is somewhere between two and a half and three and a quarter. The economy. They've come up with this, I guess, theory that monetary policy is restrictive because of real inflation rates. But I don't really go by theory. I'm a market animal. Frankly, we've found over the years that markets are better predictors than professors. And when I look at look at the landscape, equities is at a record high, gold at a record high GDP above trend, credit type bank earnings and forecasts look good. We don't see any restriction whatsoever. Crypto going crazy, you name it. So all of a sudden, the crowd that said</p>
      <p>they wanted to see the whites of inflation's eyes and they wanted to be data dependent as opposed to forward looking are now cutting 50 basis points, not a quarter, which is what they started off and we're not even to target yet. And this is all on the theory that monetary policy is restrictive. So what I would say is this I don't have the conviction I had in 21 that we wrote that article, that the Fed is going to be wrong. But on a risk reward basis, I just doesn't I don't think it makes any sense at all to to lay out the cards they've laid out and commit themselves through forward guidance once again. And what I what I was trying to say when I was saying it reminds me of 21 is I just hope if the data don't go with them and they certainly haven't since. They started this narrative, they adjust this time and they're not trapped by the forward guidance the way they were in 21. Listen, does this mean that you thought</p>
      <p>50 basis points was an absolute mistake? And do you think that there is a risk of an inflationary spike in the way we saw in the 1970s? Yeah. Do you have the chart we talked about earlier? Let's see if we can pull that up there. Certainly one that investors have been looking at. And while, you know, even if we don't have the chart, so in the 1970s, inflation came down from a remarkably similar level to where it was in 21, I think 21 peaked at nine. I think it was eight back in the seventies. They came down to three. The Fed was easing because they had the 75 recession. So the Fed started easing and inflation went right back up to I think it peaked at a 12% when Volcker came in and smashed it. I'm not predicting that. But when you're easing into a melt up in financial markets and we have the fiscal policy we have going forward, it's certainly a risk. And I just I think it's a mistake not to be taking that risk into account. I don't really understand the rush of 50</p>
      <p>basis points, and I think the markets have priced in a 97% cut at the next meeting. That's all through Fed guidance. It's funny, my my friend Jim Grant, who's one of my favorite writers, said they're not really data dependent. They're for guidance dependent. And that's what they're showing again. And look, he might be right and I hope he is right, but it's a big risk because if in fact, they're wrong and inflation takes off because monetary policy is in fact not restrictive and we have fiscal expansion going on and they have to tighten again, I think it could be a it could be a nightmare for markets and maybe even for the independence of the Fed. You can't you can't make multiple mistakes that that would have been. But I'm not predicting I'm just saying why did they go 50 and why do they need this forward guidance? You know, I'm glad you brought up the Fed independence. I wanted your view on this. Are you concerned about the independence in the scenario of a Donald Trump win?</p>
      <p>In an interview just a day ago with Bloomberg editor in chief John Micklethwait, he said that the job at the Fed is to show up in the office once a month and say, let's flip a coin. On the other hand, your long time colleague, Scott Bessant has been informally advising Trump and floated the idea of a shadow Fed chair. How compromised is Fed independence at this juncture? Well, I think a shadow Fed and this kind of talk is a horrible idea and irresponsible. However, I think where Trump to be elected, the institution will hold. I think a bigger threat to the Fed would would be major, major mistakes by the Fed. And I think the Fed is obsessed with soft landings and fine tuning. To me, that's not the real job. The real job is to avoid the kind of problems we had with the great financial crisis, which in my opinion, were because the Fed was too easy going and them create a housing bubble. And then obviously after COVID, not the initial actions, but sticking with it for a year and a half for</p>
      <p>buying bonds with the money supply exploding to me, they've got to stop the fine tuning and start looking at the bigger picture and committing yourselves now and then. If they stick to forward guidance and inflation starts going up again, that could lead to a hard landing, not a soft landing. Speaking of the future, of course, another big uncertainty ahead beyond Federal Reserve policy is the November election. I'm wondering what the Druckenmiller playbook is around this election cycle and what you think the most likely scenario is and how you set up for it. Well, it's an evolving situation. I if you had asked me this 12 days ago, I would have said, I don't have a clue as to the total costs up. I still don't have conviction who is going to win on the election. But as I said earlier, I like market indicators for the economy and for financial restrictiveness. I also like them for elections. I remember how right the market was on</p>
      <p>Ronald Reagan in 1980, despite what the pundits were saying. And I must say in the last 12 days, the market and the inside of the market is very convinced Trump is going to win. You can see it in the bank stocks, you can see it in crypto, you can even see it in DJT, his social media company. But throughout the whole, I would say, the industries that are deregulated if we had deregulation, will benefit from Trump or outperforming the others. So. If you put a gun to my head and thank God there's not one in my head, so this really doesn't matter. I wouldn't say that. I would have to guess Trump is the favorite to win the election now, but who knows what these polls even mean. No one even responds to them anymore. But that's what we're looking at. I think the delta between, let's say, four outcomes, blue sweep, red sweep, Trump with a with a blue branch of</p>
      <p>Congress. HARRIS With a red branch of Congress. First of all, I think the blue sleeve sweep is extremely unlikely. Even if Harris wins the presidency, local at state by state polls, it looks like the Republicans are going to win the Senate where you get a blue sweep. I think just the math of taxes, business confidence, lack of animal spirits, no change in the regulation front in investors minds. You could get a you would have a rough time for equities, I would think for 3 to 6 months. I think this would probably translate in the economy because equity ownership is 25% of financial assets at an all time high. That was 15% just not that long ago. So that's a blue sweep. But the good news or the bad news,</p>
      <p>depending on how you view life is, I think it's highly unlikely. So that playbook is probably going to be irrelevant. So what about a red sweep? A red sweep, which I think is probably more likely than a Trump presidency with a with a blue Congress. Because personally, I think anybody that votes for Trump is probably not going to switch their. The transfer are valid for a Democrat in Congress. A red sweep. I think you get animal spirits in the business community. You get deregulation and there might be some sort of uplift relative to where they were and in terms of the business community. So I think the economy could be potentially stronger for 3 to 6 months. My fear would be because of those reasons and because I think bond yields already don't reflect a proper economic outlook. You will probably get a bad response in</p>
      <p>the fixed income markets, which could then snuff out the equity rally. But any view we have to calm family office where we're worried about bonds. We're not playing it through the stock market. We're playing it through the bond market. If you want to go after the cause rather than the symptoms are, still look like there's stocks and things to do. I also think under a red sweep, the Fed, for the reasons I just illustrated, and maybe because of past relationships, would be much more hawkish than they would be under a Harris administration. So I think that would all be in our playbook and the responses to it under a Harris administration with a Republican Congress, probably not a lot of change from the landscape we currently have in terms of trying to figure out what's going to happen. I want to remind our viewers, if you're just tuning in right now, I'm standing by with Stanley Druckenmiller for our Bloomberg Television and radio offices.</p>
      <p>Of course, he leads the Duquesne family office. And you we're talking through each scenario here. But what about your personal views here? In a recent conference, you had mentioned that you wouldn't vote for either Kamala Harris or Donald Trump. Which concerns you more. Which concerns me more. I am a I like Bret Stephens line in the New York Times. I haven't decided who I'm going to vote against. I can't see my voting self voting for either one of them. So it really doesn't matter whose concerns you are and I certainly will never would never support either one of them. I just think they're actually unified on some things like industrial policy. Both of them think apparently the government should have a major role in allocating capital, which I find frankly. Sonali bizarre. When I think back ten or 15 years.</p>
      <p>I'm a I'm a reader of Tom Friedman and quite quite a good writer. And he was constantly pointing out how the Chinese model was potentially superior to the US model. Talking about how nicer airports were and their roads and how they could target certain industries. Well, my long suspicions have been confirmed and China's been, as we all know, a disaster with that model. But somehow both parties, Republican and Democrats, have adopted industrial policy, kind of throwing free market Reagan capitalism to the side. So the policies in terms of that I find equally bad. I find her policies much worse in terms of and I think this anti-business and regulation. Well, frankly, I, I grew up in America with a certain model of a president George Washington, Thomas Jefferson. Ronald Reagan was one in my lifetime</p>
      <p>where there was a certain dignity in behavior in the office. And I don't judge anyone who wants to vote for for Trump. But for me, it's just a red line. So I'll probably write in someone when I go to the polls. When you think about the policies Donald Trump has put forward, a day ago, he said to Bloomberg that tariff is the most beautiful word in the dictionary. He's negated the idea that many economists believe that this could have many punitive impacts on the American consumer. How do you see it? Well, I don't like tariffs. I'm know I just said I'm a free market car plus. The only thing I'll say about Trump is a bit of a blowhard. So I don't know whether he's negotiating with with our foreign adversaries and frankly, with our foreign partners. I don't think it will be in the world. But I. I am not in favor of tariffs. I don't like Trump at all.</p>
      <p>You know, it's interesting, by the way, the Biden administration kept all his tariffs. So it's not like I'm a fan of their tariff policy either. What about taxation? At the end of the day, you have been very, very critical for many years about the US debt load, the fiscal situation. And there are analyses that said both candidates would increase the federal debt load. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said Trump more than the Harris administration would. At the end of the day, can Congress get away with extending the tax cuts from the Trump era? Or is there another way to really close the gap? Look, in my world, the less taxes the better. But we live in a world that I hope still includes compromise. And if there's some sort of agreement for spending cuts, I could definitely tolerate tax increases to balance them. I will say one thing I don't I don't really like the media narrative</p>
      <p>which compares fiscal irresponsibility with tax cuts and fiscal irresponsibility with spending. And again, you're right. I'm a fiscal hawk. I'm a lot more about or more worried about this and the effect four or five years out and whether we have a soft landing and our economy grows at 1.2 or two. This is big stuff we're talking about. But tax cuts are accompanied by additions addition to the capital stock. Spending is a shrinking in the capital stock replaced by government spending. So of the two, the two sins tax cuts are less. But personally, if I was in government, you can't just do tax cuts if you don't get the spending cuts. And it was Trump to me that took entitlements off the table in 2016. And that's where the money is. So I give him an F on fiscal responsibility also. So want to switch gears here because we</p>
      <p>only have a little bit of time left with you. I want to talk about the market and I want to talk about how you're looking at certain wagers that you put on. A while ago, we spoke about Nvidia, and you had said that it would be something that you held for years. And ever since then you held it for a while, but more recently you have been selling it off. How much do you have left of it and why have you been selling? Can you see yourself getting back into it again? I've made so many mistakes in my investment career. One of them was I sold online video probably in somewhere between 809 50. I think it's 1300 on that stock down you own. And today I own nine and I own, nonetheless, 400 points. It was a big mistake in terms of I and by the way, when I when I saw you at that conference, which was 18 months ago, I fully expected to own it for years, but I think it was 300 and change. And as I also said in a media interview,</p>
      <p>I'm not Warren Buffett. So I thought I thought I was going in. But what changed is it tripled in a year. And I, I thought the valuation was rich. We are big term long term believers in A.I., and there's still many ways we're playing AI, particularly the infrastructure that's been built out to support the power needed. And yes, I think it really is a wonderful company and where the price to come down, we get involved again. But right now I'm licking my wounds from a bad sale there. You know, the other question I have to ask you really quickly, we don't have a lot of time, but you were saying that you expressed a lot of your views through the bond market. The ten year hit 4.1% again recently. Do you think it goes much higher and where do you think it ends next year? Would you go very short at this rate? I don't know what very short means. We shorted bonds the day the Fed cut 50 because we thought it was a mistake. We still have that position. It's not so much. I have a view on where it's</p>
      <p>short term, what I what I do believe if if Powell ends up being wrong here and inflation accelerates next year, bonds could go up a lot a lot of basis points, hundreds. Whereas if he's right, you might lose 25 or 30 basis points short. The golden rule I've always had is is the ten year should trade around where nominal GDP is, which is five and a half percent. So the risk reward to me is being short bonds.</p>

      <div class="transcript-body">
      <p>to the 507th meeting of the Economic Club in New York and our one hundred and twelfth year I'm gonn Hutchins vice chairman of the club and co-founder of North Island the Economic Club in New York as the nation's leading non partisan forum for speeches on economic social and political issues more than 1,000 speakers have appeared before the club over the last century and we've established a strong tradition of national excellence which I'm quite confident will persist and be reinforced today before you start I want to take a moment to thank the many members of the Centennial society who are attending here tonight the the club is I think one of the best bargains in New York so you should all join if you're not members but the Centennial Society of those people who have actually chosen to give us more money to support the operations the club made the capital gifts and they play a special role in ensuring that the club remains financially sound now in the future we'd also like to welcome our of 2008 19 class of Economic Club of New York fellows who are young and</p>
      <p>up-and-coming members of our business and technology communities in financial communities in New York it's great to have you with us tonight so it's my pleasure today to introduce our speaker this evening Stan Druckenmiller chairman and chief executive officer of the Duquesne family office which he founded in 1981 which in which he ran until they closed the firm at the end of 2010 from 1988 to 2000 he was managing director of Soros Fund management where he served as the lead portfolio manager by the way I should say I'm supposed to give this bio but if you don't know Stan's bio you're probably in the wrong room and they'll be a test afterwards whether I got it right Lee portfolio manager of the Quantum Fund and chief investment officer of Soros and had overall responsibility for funds with an asset value of at least twenty two billion dollars Stan is also as evidenced by who he's sitting with here tonight as an active member of our community and very involved in</p>
      <p>philanthropy he's chairman of the board of the Harlem Children's Zone on organization nine I think very very highly of chairman of the blue Meridian Partners board member of Memorial sloan-kettering they're already already talking about they're worried about their investment results for today and of the Environmental Defense Fund he's a member of the investment committee by the Union anybody who has stand on his investment committee is very fortunate Bowdoin College and co-founder I think this is fun and board member of the Kasparov chess foundation the format today is that we're fortunate to have another great investor friend of mine Scott Besant chief executive officer and chief investment officer of the key square group doing the honors speaking Scott was the chief investment officer for Soros Fund Management the investment vehicle for the Soros family and their foundations from 2011 to 2015 frequent contributor to the International economy including a recent article reason on reforming the Fed he was kind enough not to press me on that during cocktails from 2006 to 2010 he was an adjunct</p>
      <p>professor of at Yale where he taught economic history he's profiled in the book macro investors inside the house of money and featured prominently on mieze history of hedge funds more money than God he's a frequent speaker on economic and investment panels and Scott thank you very much for being here today to do this many of you in the audience have shared your questions in advance those have been given to Scott to inform the questions which he's going to ask and at the end of their conversation I'll come back up to the stage and we'll ask for questions from the audience which I recommend being substantive and short and I want to remind everybody that this conversation is on the record and being carried live gentlemen the stage is yours [Applause] great well thank you Glenn I'm excited to be here today and to interview my</p>
      <p>friend and mentor Stan Druckenmiller we got a lot to cover we have the sputtering economy the US and rest of the world the flip-flopping fed the petulant president a little China Syndrome and then maybe some advice on how to navigate these conditions to begin with I would say I've had mostly the good fortune of speaking the stand every week for a couple of decades and I'd say mostly because if he's having a bad day you're gonna have a bad day on the phone so I thought tonight we would go through the equivalent of one of our phone conversations so why don't we get right into it you don't speak very often in public and you and Kevin Worf pinned an article in The Wall Street Journal this past December outlining why you thought the Fed was making a policy er if they raised rates and I'm curious the what</p>
      <p>you were thinking then because for the past three four years you had been urging them to raise rates correct I love to contradict myself I need to go into a little background with the first part but what the answer the first question is even though I thought rates were still too low relative to maybe where they should have been by that time period we had observed that the global economy particularly trade this was pre the latest antics was starting to slow down and we were afraid it could seep into the US economy probably more important in my mind we were in a meltdown in financial conditions and since 1913 when the Fed had been founded the Fed had never hiked with the decline we'd had in the SP and</p>
      <p>other indexes going into that now that was the primary reason the the editorial has been way over read and way over analyzed the last two words in it were for now the Fed shouldn't hike for now take a pause and just see how things develop there's some background those got you're correct let me start from the very beginning I will go to my grave and often wrong never end out believing that really loose monetary policy greatly contributed to the financial crisis there were obviously problems with regulation but when we had a 1% Fed Funds rate in 2003 after to me it was pretty obvious the economy had turned</p>
      <p>and I think the economy was growing at 7 and 9% nominal in the fourth quarter of Oh 3 and that wasn't enough for Fed they had this little thing called considerable period on top of the 1% rate just so we would make sure that their meaning was clear and it was all wrapped around this concept of an insurance cut the last one an insurance policy but the history of what I have seen and you know I've I've made some money predicting boom-bust cycles it's what I do sometimes I'm right sometimes I'm wrong but every bus I had ever seen was preceded by an asset bubble a generally set up by Toulouse policy and the latest one at that time period that had just occurred was obviously Japan responding to our pleas in their own after the plaza Accord setting up the</p>
      <p>the bubble in the second half of the 80s and then we all know what happened in the 90s so that's sort of the background I come out this with stance so we can go to more recent history the this time last year you got the Alexander Hamilton award from the Manhattan Institute and during it was really slim pickings obviously what nikki Haley was on the other side so the an opening act but you said if I were trying to create a deflationary bust I would do exactly what the world central banks have been doing for the past six now seven years the what did you mean by that yeah so I think Bernanke and and the rest of the Fed did an unbelievable job once the bust occurred in oh nine the QE</p>
      <p>was aggressive it was decisive interest rate policy every everything they did was spot-on but coming out of the crisis and I loved QE one coming out of the crisis qe2 I wasn't thrilled with QE 3 I was really disappointed with and the reason was I was very fearful that the emergency days were over and the possibility was we were going to set up another misallocation of resources the most recent one I was obviously the one I referred to which was the low interest rates which created the housing bubble so I mean 2012 came around 2013-2014 economy kept getting better and better and better and every time I would give a talk like this which was not very often and everybody said well what would what would you do would you actually raise rates I said yeah I would sneak one in every time financial conditions allowed</p>
      <p>and hopefully by some point rates will be high enough that we'll have an appropriate hurdle rate for investment where people won't be doing stupid things like they have in last asset bubbles but as you know Scott we got all the way into 2014 and 15 and we're still doing two III and I was just afraid that people were going to start to do stupid things and indeed they have I'll just give you a few things that occurred since 2010 so corporate debt in 2010 was six trillion dollars it's now 10 trillion dollars so it's grown 65 percent I don't know what anybody thinks about that it's not necessarily disaster it depends of what they borrowed but I would point out that during that same period corporate profits grew from 1.7 trillion to 2.2 trillion so on a that's cumulative over eight years so on a four trillion dollar increase in debt we got</p>
      <p>five hundred billion in corporate profits but it's worse than that the interest cost on the extra four trillion in debt only went up 23% from four hundred and seventy-five two to five hundred and sixty five billion so think about the horrendous return productivity of capital here you you increase your debt sixty five percent but your interest costs only go up twenty three percent you would think your profits would explode with that formula they went up 29% over eight years not in one year you know they compounded with less than a three handle you might ask wait wait corporate profits have been great no I'm talking about total corporate profits not earnings per share which is the other misallocation of resources during that time period five point seven trillion buybacks financial engineering versus two point two trillion in capital expenditures and</p>
      <p>if you go back to 2010 capital expenditures were twenty percent I'm sorry buybacks were twenty percent of capital expenditures they're now fifty five percent with a much higher stock market so you can sort of see where I'm going with this you're getting a pretty gross buildup in the private sector and by the way if you look at it the companies that are growing innovating they're not the ones who are borrowing the money it's not Google or Facebook they're spending their brains out on innovation it's old dying retail companies companies would by the way 24 square feet per capita in this country and that number is three in Germany and two in China but we have all these zombies walking around so here we are and probably the most innovative I would say economic disrupted period since the late 1800s in you're hardly standing bankruptcies because there have been no market signals from the Fed now this is</p>
      <p>pre the last year we'll get into that but there's one other problem with all this and that's our government government responds to market signals too and the clowns in Washington unless they get a signal from the bond market they're just going to keep spending so for the first time in history we have massive deficits and full employment estimates are this year there'll be a trillion dollars god help us have we got in a recession if you just take the mean of what happens in the recession that would go to a trillion eight debt to GDP has gone from 65 to 105 so you get the drift so this is where we were going into this fall I felt that Bernanke and Yellen in particular there were so many opportunities to just put a quarter end quarter in wall financial markets were booming but fear of deflation prevented them from doing so there's this belief at the Fed that if you're near the zero bound</p>
      <p>you're near deflation and that can cause you know that's the boogeyman that we dealt with in the 1930s Japanese dealt with but I've never seen a deflation happened because you were near the zero bound everyone was preceded by an asset bubble and we to me are creating a misallocation of resources and an asset bubble that could set up a deflation and that's why I said what I did pretty long answer to a simple question so the Fed shouldn't be taking a victory lap we've had malinvestment no hurdle for capital they what are your thoughts on the new inflation target and how did QE contribute to income or wealth inequality I just don't understand the 2 percent inflation obsession we had 3 percent deflation in the late 1800s and the economy grew at 8 percent real for 10 years we had inflation of less than this level in the 1950s with the Fed</p>
      <p>Funds at 4 and we were just fine it's very clear to me but office not the Fed and they got the phd's not me that you need a hurdle rate for investment and if you don't have a hurdle rate for investment bad things happened and there are periods when maybe at minus 1 percent inflation rate is appropriate in other periods where it might be 3 or 4 it depends on what's going on but we are in the middle in my opinion of one of the great productivity shocks in the last 150 years I understand the government statistics don't show it although we just had a very good quarter in productivity but to me it's it's immeasurable because our measurements haven't caught up with it yet and by the way I don't have the answer the measurements I just know they're not right I'll just give you a couple of examples three and a half billion searches a day on Google YouTube</p>
      <p>in the last sixty days has had more content uploaded on it original content then the entire television industry is done in the last 60 years in 2010 we took 300 billion pictures last year we took two and a half trillion pictures we took more pictures last year than since the beginning of civilization the marginal cost of those pictures is zero the quality with the phone in my pocket is better than it was with the best cameras 10 years ago and in GDP accounting okay since you're not paying 50 cents to go and get your Kodak film process it actually subtracts from from GDP accounting now I understand they get some advertising goes over here but there's no way to measure this stuff and I could go on and on I think everybody in this room there was a study out of MIT that you'd pay eighteen thousand a year to use Google search I'd pay a lot more than that $3,500 to pay good use</p>
      <p>Google Maps all this stuff is free so it's mismeasured it's the same thing with inflation by the way so why in the hell we're sitting here going off 1.4 1.6 1.7 we don't know what these numbers are we don't know what GDP growth is we don't know what inflation is and we are in a Productivity boom so I'm not I'm not convinced that minus 1 or minus 2 percent deflation wouldn't be bad what we're all going to say oh my god I'm not going to buy something this month so because Google's making my life cheaper if we've had a positive support if we've had a positive supply shock then your view is low inflation and disinflation aren't bad the is it possible the Fed asset bubbles are going on yeah so the that the Fed is focused on the disinflation and the asset bubbles blowing up over here as a result the but is it possible they just miss the</p>
      <p>secular dynamic of platform companies the and the sharing economy I guess so I don't understand all this stuff you know our star U star Z store they just look like you know with with all the stuff going on to be talking about that just sort of astonishes make and it would probably be about 50th down on my list I had a colleague it was not Kevin worst I swear on my children who was at the Chicago monetary conference two weeks ago and I or was a week ago as a Friday I said how did it go in the meantime we've done all these tariffs all this crazy stuff oh it's the night of the tariff thing when leha is going back to China and the markets in a complete meltdown and I said how was the conference's oh they're really feeling much better about things and they're very comforted and I said why because Michigan inflation expectations five to</p>
      <p>ten years out ticked up from two point five to two point six I'm like seriously this is this is what we're focused on right in this country and by the way no kidding these guys all have 30 IQ points on me so I just don't get it but well we just we just had the one of the biggest two-day moves in the history of a two year so maybe they were focusing on the wrong thing who knows so why don't we talk a little about your economic methodology the you you the Stan always taught me the micro drives the macro can you explain what that means and how you use it yeah well first of all I was a dropout of the ph.d program in Michigan so we'll start with that but when I got in the business it was it became clear to me that well</p>
      <p>macroeconomic statistics are not great in terms of predicting the economy they're really great in terms of telling you where you are and where you bend but in terms of predictive ability they're not great by far the best economic predictor I've ever met is the inside of the stock market I don't mean the stock market I mean the inside of the stock market and that's looking at cyclical companies within the stock market and I particularly like because it tends to be the right kind of timing trucking retail that kind of stuff the Russell 2000 so if you just look at at the periods I've analyzed generally those stocks start going down and defensive stocks and secular growth stocks start going up on a relative basis so what's that telling us now well it's very clear the xrt the retail index is down 24%</p>
      <p>since the high in August I think the stock market is only down seven or eight it was five when I was preparing for this the the Russell 2000 is down 15% with a lot of breath in that decay the the ESPY metals is down 20% and unless until today which hopefully was some I'll go otherwise I'm just dead wrong which I am occasionally it's been very clear all that stuff is at 52-week relatively lows and all the companies you would analyze that probably do about the same and a 1% nominal economy as a three they're all at relative highs so the inside of the stock market right now it's not saying we're gonna be in a recession but it's saying you better you better be careful and keep your eyes open it hymens in the audience one of the people that taught me a lot of stuff in the business and that's the other thing we just talked to companies and some companies you know lead the cycle and some companies lag the cycle and you don't really like to take look</p>
      <p>talk to the CEO she talked to the purchasing manner should get a little you get a little down and that's more mixed right now so it's not that clear another indicator we use I've never seen a recession before corporate profits peaked hasn't happened that was great news until two weeks ago when we got our first flow funds account and it turns out corporate profits look pretty bad in the first quarter they were down and if you look at margins and labor tariffs everything else going on it's inconceivable to me that that wasn't the peak in corporate profits so we're now five months into that so I I am not willing to say we're going down but I'm willing to say there's a lot of warning signs out there that give me great caution down in the economy yeah yep yeah and not to mention the obvious trade wars killing animal spirits all that kind of stuff I'm trying to cite some of the some of the unobvious so one</p>
      <p>of the big debates over the past twelve months has been quantitative tightening Federal Reserve insist it doesn't exist the have you've seen it I'm just a dumb money manager and I remember number one I remember in 2010 whenever they did QE 1 arguing with some of my peers before it happened that QE would be buying bonds would be bearish for bonds and they looked at me like what is wrong with you and by the way I was dead wrong for five weeks and my theory was QE the buying of bonds by the government would cause risk to go up and therefore decrease the demand for bonds from other entities it took about five weeks but it worked then we stopped QE and sure enough like the day we stopped Huey in other words buying a bonds this 2011 bonds went up</p>
      <p>Ochs went down Everybody blamed it on Boehner and Obama having a hissy fit with each other in the White House but I have followed this for eight years and it was seven four seven with when the government buys bonds bonds go down when the government and stocks go up and vice versa so as some people in the room who are on some boards I'm on know about a year ago I started worrying that cutie was going to hit financial assets and it did hit well I won't say it hit it the stock market started going down when we went from QE to cutie the actual global date was October 1st and so yes I believe in it we're still doing it but oh that's the other thing that's going on we have three more months of this stuff it's a</p>
      <p>very interesting environment to be doing quantitative tightening and as you can tell I'm not like some perma dove right so the on the politics you know this is fun so you and I had talked we thought tech was the ultimate disruptor in the economy but now we don't have a black swan we have what I call an iron swan and it's an original by the way in itself traveling the industry did President Trump just break a fragile economy going into an election I don't know is the answer as you know I remember Bernanke who doesn't have 30 sqp IQ propellants him he's got like a hundred on me saying he's from South Carolina so yeah saying so prime was contained and what he didn't calculate</p>
      <p>where all the ripple effects and animal spirits going to shore to shore terror spirits and if you just add up the tariffs we've done by themselves it's quite debatable whether this is going to hurt the economy or not and in fact Peter and Navarro apparently has convinced the president that it's going to help GDP accounting because exports obviously go up relative to imports but there's a good chance that by hindsight and by the way I got caught with my pants down I didn't see him doing what he did but I also didn't see this looking back the is MS factory orders a lot of stuff was rolling over a month before we did our China thing so my real answer is I don't know B it really concerns me that yes he may have right so in 1992 when you started teaching me macro the my impression was as half politics half economics and then in 2002 after the.com</p>
      <p>the money spigots got opened and it was all just money now it seems like we're back to politics the matter as much as money flows the how should we think about that yeah when April everyone I was so bullish so I was 93 percent long when the guy did his thing and I said well the only risk is political but everybody knows you're not gonna be stupid enough tenth the trade deal blow up so I was wrong we're in a bear market in politics I mean there's just there's just no question about it in every country across the board you've got this populism this protectionism I don't care what they say they're you I will go to my grave you're not going to tell me that protectionism is as good as free trade I just don't believe it so and this weird sort of populist saying and</p>
      <p>I'm glad you mentioned the Hamilton speech because I think I named it can we try capitalism we just seem to be moving further and further away from it where the president attacks Amazon Ori attacks AT&T today because apparently CNN kicked him off and just all this stuff it's not good does it matter I don't know again it's part of a big puzzle but it's certainly one piece it doesn't look very good well it seems like when risk equity risk premiums low the VIX is low the you get political volatility coming through so political volatility in 2016 you thought from could win I thought he would win the now most of our Wall Street brethren it's kind of 9 to 1 the president's likely going to be re-elected what do you think's priced in and how do you think</p>
      <p>the market should think about this well I try to avoid these tout dinners but when I go to them if I ask if presidents can be re-elected they don't say yes I steer at me and go of course so I assume the market whatever that is thinks he's going to get reelected I personally think it's going to depend on the Democratic candidate but he drew us inside straight he won seven out of seven states by less than half a percent and if you go county by county in Pennsylvania at Michigan and Wisconsin he is in deep deep deep trouble and that was with the economy growing at 3% so I personally don't believe unless they put up one of the 2/3 crazies I can't remember how many there are I think he I think he's got I'm assuming he's going to get beat I think the market assumes differently I think if he does lose particularly if if I'm wrong</p>
      <p>and a crazy beats him I mean it's it's worth a lot of PE points a lot so you think Trump all Felician 2021 or comrade Sanders is worth worse for the market I'm gonna write in for you terrible all right so now the the Panda in the room China yeah yeah can you the frame that forth a little yeah I think those who believe a conflict between the United States and China is inevitable and apparently most people believe that obviously if you're from the United States and you believe that you want the conflict now there's a billion is it a billion for how many people they have over there billion for people they're catching us and probably good chance</p>
      <p>pass this at some point technologically we have no chance against China if there's a conflict in 30 years if you're China okay an economic conflict or a kinetic conflict or both either okay either military or economic if you're China I think if you think there's going to be a conflict you have the same view don't know whether we can win now we're definitely when and if it happens in 30 years so I think this is probably the genesis of this on the very immediate term as I said I did not expect the lovely tweet that interrupted my golf game on Sunday afternoon about a month ago but having said that and seen the situation from them my impression is that at this moment in time which is the only thing you can ever say about Trump at this moment in time he does not want an extra 325 billion in</p>
      <p>tariffs he doesn't see any marginal gain for that but he does want tariffs on when the election happens he wants to run on tariffs he thinks they are a winning formula in the swing states and the belligerent sort of verbose pressure he's putting in the braggadocio toward China he's giving Xi Jinping no off-ramps to make a deal and I'm it's funny because to two to three weeks ago I thought I was here and the market was here on the prospects of a deal this being deal this being no deal and I think the markets kind of here now and I'm here so I'm not that far I'm not that much more negative than what's priced than the market itself but my working assumption is with the economy here I would have told you a week ago in the S&P here there's no chance of a deal</p>
      <p>but my guess is the economy is not going to be here in November of twenty and I don't know where the SP is going to be but I think those will factor into it but it it's bad and the Huawei thing is real so when we were talking in yesterday you said you thought you know if we get the decline in the SP and the Mexican tariffs were bad for the u.s. negotiating position yeah they're terrible I mean I see Jim Penge I'd be doing cartwheels because Lee Hogg comes back he's a reformer he thought the deal was not just he thought the deal was actually in China's interests because it undermines the SOE and doesn't does a lot of other reforms the old guard and the Politburo and in my opinion Xi Jinping did not feel that way they came back it was pretty obvious at White House her and taken leha's pants down in the negotiation when the Politburo saw it</p>
      <p>and she's in st. Paul that was the end of that but there was still some fight but can you imagine trying to defend the deal if you're leha this week after I mean okay there's a problem at the border but economically and after Mexico did everything we asked they did everything right and this is how the guy behaves if you make a deal on them so to me she's Jinping and the hardliners just got a very very big gift from from Donald Trump doing what he did to Mexico so you're not a nationalist you're not a monopolist the but today the Justice Department opened an investigation into Amazon Google and Apple and it seems like the opposite of what China is doing with Huawei in terms of defend protect so this is amazing to me I'm not a nationalist I don't even know about this economic war but if you are gonna have an economic war with China and you're</p>
      <p>looking ahead okay where do you fight the war to me you fight it with a AI and they you know you go where the future is going so the minute this trade stuff started happening last fall they started easing up on their private sector particularly Tencent Alabama they're huge supporters of Huawei they're oiling their whole high-tech machine all their engineers what are we doing oh we're saving steel coal aluminum really the future here guys and what are we doing with our leading tech companies we're throwing sand in the gears and making their life miserable and by the way if I hear one more clown on TV telling me that Google's innovate anti innovation by the way I do not own Google come on I mean if look at the products we're using from that company and the reason that stocks on tyrants are spending a fortune trying to do more new stuff and by the way this thing about it's harming consumer cuz all the products are free</p>
      <p>so I'm I'm really on the other side of this this thing about like and I am NOT a nationalist but if we're going to be in some kind of conflict it's going to be fought among the big tech company it's not our aluminum steel companies we're going to get rolled notes I mean it's amazing that the the general narrative is the president she can't stand the chairman of Huawei or the rendered a plane and the you know obviously the Jeff Bezos isn't the president's favorite person well they were not happy with each other but it's their champion and he's their champion and now they're now they're partners whereas you're right the president not real fun of mr. Bies us and we're getting the gong or you are not me we're gonna move into the next phase of our conversation by other guys that was terrific thank you and have questions from the audience I have a very large type that says do not call on the media in the back row so if you</p>
      <p>won't raise your hands I won't be rude to you by not calling on you Lynn do you want to start off good take taking microphone introduce yourself can we everybody hear that try it again I'll repeat the question if it doesn't work you talked about how there are signs for caution that the economy may have peaked what would be a defensive investment posture now a week ago I would have told you Treasuries they you had the great thing with your golf pro two weeks ago that you told me but you know we were in a board meeting together and some of you have probably played this golf course to national and we had this old pro there and whenever it was blowing really hard there be Whitecaps on the bay and he said when the pro when when they're Whitecaps on the bay the pro don't play when the Trump tweet went out I went from 93 percent invested to net flat and bought a bunch of Treasuries not because</p>
      <p>I'm trying to make money I just I don't want to play in this environment they're gonna be better environments to take a shot so I think if you're confident in your long-term view and your ability to make money this is not a great environment to be going to vet in the or Antion one way or the other not short not long it's in terms of the economy though if if you believe that the the obvious posture would be would be Treasuries but that's I actually own a lot of Treasuries and when I bought them I wasn't sure rates were going going to go down what I was sure is they weren't going to go up and I thought they were a one-way bet but with the two-year at 184 you've got 75 basis points a carry in that thing right now that's the way the the roll goes it's a two-way bet so they're becoming less interesting but if you believe the economy is going to deteriorate they're</p>
      <p>the best game in town those not Gold's not bad either cover questions someone else here in the back row there gentlemen and then we'll come over here thanks so much Stan Warren Buffett has called Bitcoin rat poison square on the other side you have folks like Peter Thiel who I think most people in this audience would agree have done a better job at being ahead of the curve in predicting disruptive technologies could you share your thoughts with us about Bitcoin it's probably one of the few asset classes in the world that has done a better job rallying over the past few months than Treasuries I look at Bitcoin as a solution in search of a problem I don't understand why we need this thing and the great thing they're out there talking about is a stable cryptocurrency well it's to me that's called the dollar</p>
      <p>now if we keep weaponizing tariffs and sanctions and everything else we're doing maybe five or ten years down the road but the pro don't play I don't I just don't need to be playing in Bitcoin I wouldn't be shorted I wouldn't be long it I don't think I'm a Neanderthal which is what I've been called when I set it in when I own Bitcoin you keep telling me it's gonna be a store of value like gold maybe I mean it could go to a million but I don't understand why it's a store of value other than you can't create it well there's a lot of things you can't create that aren't gonna go to a million so other questions back here it's only young yeah right there two quick questions Stan one just going through your political analysis you seem to imply that the crazies are worse than the president are there any so-called enlightened Democrats and could one of those guys actually win that's first</p>
      <p>question I got one short follow-up I didn't mean to imply that they're worse than the president I you know if I vote for Scott think how bad they both are I that's just such a horrible choice you know I'm a big proponent of free markets and both of them seemed to me to be taking away from free market capitalism obviously if you're investing in stocks you're going to like Trump better than the crazies despite all the inner interventions he does but you know I yeah I'm just depressed about both sides of the coin I will say that one thing that really annoys me is and I'm not a hater well sort of is this narrative well the policies are great well first of all there's more than policies to the</p>
      <p>job of the president is states there's a dignity office there's a role model you're sitting for the rest of the country there's leadership and to me that's important part of being president but by the way I don't I don't know how great the policies are there's a lot of crony capitalism and stuff going on to me nobody's been more for tax reform than me and then when he looked at that thing my god the stuff that was in there you can buy a used jet now and write the whole thing off in the first year it's bad enough that I'm gonna buy a new one and I can write all that off and I can see how that causes production but how does it use jet why do you get to write that off I'm not so sure the I would vote for you enthusiastically my nine year olds here so he he wouldn't vote for him when you call yes so there are three ways to get rid of the president impeachment the 25th amendment or the the ballot box which way do you think it</p>
      <p>will be Oh at this point in time you'd be crazy to do anything but the ballot box it'd take a year I have to impeach him the country would go through hell it's just it doesn't make any sense questions over here in the back on the right hand side thanks Dan Alberto Masada NASA events asset management you spoke of markets from the from the issuer side and I wonder from the buyer side of markets financial institutions or groups of people what worries you what worries me as a buyer or about the buyers know about the buyers so where are the problems as you see them well I think we've all been forced per my first rant we've all been forced way out the risk curve and we bone a bone a bunch of assets that we don't necessarily believe in but I don't know whether Jason is here but that Tina thing there is no</p>
      <p>alternative that's a hell of a reason not to own an asset but we're all guilty of it so yeah that's that's what worries me the most is that we own a bunch of assets and by the way there's derivatives positions out there too that that ultimately they're probably in weak hands that's for voting quite over here in the bet over here one of the odd does China have to lose in order for America to win is this a duality that we have to deal with is there another way to go back just tryna have to lose in order for America the game because the way we are going it's just animosity people to me with these two leaders I think the answer is yes I think with a different two leaders absolutely not I think this didn't have to happen but with a leader for life who put out the 2025 scenario and Trump and now</p>
      <p>frankly I will say one thing Trump has really moved the needle in a bipartisan consensus in this country that's justice that's really astonishing I mean China has no friends on the Democratic side I think the answer to your question two years ago was absolutely they don't have to lose right now I'm kind of worried that the answer to your question is yes given given the players and the entities we have my partner Kevin worse you I think the world of he thinks Donald Trump will be the most Pro China president in the next thirty years he thinks that's what kind of cold war were heading into over here young man they're giving you focus a lot on liquidity I was wondering what you thought of the present liquidity conditions in the market not like the old days they're</p>
      <p>tough I mean SSPs are not as liquid as they were 10 or 15 years ago Treasuries their days when they're not liquid I'd say it's fadi you get these ball and these algo episodes and if you're on the wrong side of there's no liquidity if you were on the other side of it there's tremendous liquidity but the quiddity is a moving animal it's things can be very liquid and then three weeks later there can be no liquidity whatsoever so I don't know what I answered your question generally all right here thank you give me your assessment of where China and the US are and the characteristics of the two presidents here for a u.s. global investor either sue any China play short and long term if so in what form I mean maybe I'm an idiot but I own Alibaba and 10 cent and I own some private growth companies over there my</p>
      <p>portfolio has basically been long disruptors and short disrupted for like three or four years now and those companies to me they're there their growth rates I see are not going to be that messed up by us there they can they can do a lot of domestic growth there so yeah and I mean pingyang the insurance company I don't see how tariffs are going to kill that so there's a lot of names I own in China and frankly they've got if they want to if they want to pull levers and as you know I'm not a real long-term guy if they decide to pull levers they can make that place go for 18 to 24 months probably probably have more ability to do that than we do here we're kind of like handcuffed very back row over here right there yes this time I'm curious to</p>
      <p>hear your prognosis for the evolution of the hedge fund industry Givens of what seems to be a rising trend of titans like yourself converting to family office do I see more of that or my view of the hedge fund in general or the hedge fund industry in general and how it's likely to evolve well the hedge fund industry to me had like eight to ten savant superstars in the 70s and 80s and they charged rolls-royce prices and they were expected to make 25 percent a year and those eight to ten guys did and then they got nine thousand imitators who charged the same prices as those eight to ten guys what are we down to now do you know Scott I don't know I'm probably 4,000 hopefully so I think that the fees are still too high we're still going to shrink but there's probably five to ten people out there women and men who are worth more than the fees right now so</p>
      <p>there's they're still going to be superstars but we need to get back to like maybe 200 or 300 from 4,000 and if you make a large innovation the club stand will tell you who they are gentlemen right here hi Rick saying you talked about this not being a great environment for long or short but you talked about the internals in the market being positioned defense defensively versus not you talked about being hard for China not to be able to make a deal and you also said that if a Democratic president is elected that would be a couple points on the P multiple no only if one of the crazies is okay well I put the illustrate Sanders or Warren maybe 30 percent okay I mean I think it would be as big as Reagan the other way but with the market not that far off its highs I wonder why you think it's not a good environment on either side particularly the downside given that fact set well first of all I'm sure it</p>
      <p>is a good environment either short or long I just don't know what it is so I'm talking about myself myself as a myself as a practitioner this the disciplines I've used to over the years I like to make very large bets very contrary to when the Ducks are lined up and I can analyze it if you can analyze Donald Trump more power to you I've been more wrong foot it's a swan not a duck this one I've been more wrong footed by this guy and shame on me but what I have done and it's worked sure as hell didn't work today but it's worked is I've been long a lot of these secular growth companies that I think can do spectacularly well in a 1% nominal growth environment and we know who they are the cloud companies particularly the little ones the SAS companies that kind of stuff and I've been short the disrupted stuff the</p>
      <p>biggest problem for me as I made 70% of my money when I was competing in bonds and currencies and the central banks have really I can't make 30 percent a year anymore and I don't even charge fees now so it's it's a depressing environment one last question here the young young man back there I sent sorry do you think that in a prolonged downturn the Fed would consider using negative rates and what that what would that imply for the US oh yeah they're gonna do the works I mean these guys I did a Bloomberg interview might allow to say that the day the day before the Fed meeting and I said one of the reasons I didn't want them to raise rates because if they did I thought we'd have a meltdown and it would lead them to get really crazy and you know stuff that I thought was</p>
      <p>brilliant in 2009 and should be used once every 50 years is now sort of being discussed as part of the toolkit even for like a recession I don't know where they're gonna do its negative rates but one of the reasons I own the two years I could easily see them going to zero in the next year and a half easily and if I had their criteria and set out what they have laid out their metrics I would say the odds are very high that they're going to cut 50 to 100 basis points in the next year I'm not saying I would but I'm not in charge thank God but yeah I think you're going to see if this thing ends up being a misallocation of resources led problem for demand down the road everything I see out of central banks googly is radical policies ahead and an attempt to fight the thing okay</p>
      <p>so before we closing I have a couple of quick announcements the three of us aren't allowed off the stage by Barbara Van Andel until I get through these quickly the first and most important probably is the bar is still open and the food is still available across we've we've paid for it till 7:30 so please come across and and have a cocktail afterwards tomorrow we have Brian Moynihan CEO of Bank of America at is that right on June 19 David Petraeus says here former CIA director I do remember he had a military career of some note as well June 19 June 24 a former economic club board member I think certainly remember David Malpass from the World Bank Group gentlemen thank you very much for an enlightening and it [Applause] you</p>

      <p class="source-link"><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNdu2u8wRxY" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNdu2u8wRxY</a></p>
      <div class="transcript-body">
      <p>[Music] welcome to how leaders lead where every week you get to listen in while I interview some of the very best leaders in the world I break down the key learning so that by the end of the episode you'll have something simple you can apply as you develop into a better leader that's what this podcast is all about today's guest is Stanley dren Miller the number one investor in the world now I know that's a big claim but get this during his 30 years managing money for investors he had an average annual return of 31% and he never I mean never had a down year so if you're even a little bit interested in finance you're going to learn a lot from Stan including some really practical investment advice and his take on the future of our economy but more importantly there's a huge leadership lesson to learn Stan isn't afraid to Envision the future</p>
      <p>differently than other people he can see Trends and patterns others can't and then he has the courage to act on them that's a skill every leader needs to develop seeing the future differently allows us to spot opportunities and prepare for what's coming if we just go with the flow of what's current we'll always just be a part of the trend not ahead of it you're about to see for yourself how great leaders aren't afraid to see the future differently so here's my conversation with my good friend and soon to be yours Stanley [Music] driller I can't wait to dig into how you become the greatest investor of all time and how you lead but first of all I know you've got a new puppy at the house how's the potty training going with Otto he's pretty good he's about 24 for 25 every day but the 25th episode epode is not exactly ideal you know as we get into this</p>
      <p>people are going to see that you are absolutely in love with what you do talk about what you call the happiness quotient let me just say that I like to work probably about 60 hours a week now it used to be a lot more so if you're not happy at work you're kind of screwed if you add up the hours during the week I fell in love with investing really right out of graduate school I'll never forget my first interview the guy asked me where I wanted to be in 10 years and I said intellectually stimulated I didn't get the job he thought I was an idiot but seriously every event in the world affects some security somewhere so you're constantly keeping yourself involved with what's going on in the world and trying to figure out the puzzle and envision the world as it might be as opposed to it is the way now and it's been a love affair from the day I got in the business you know you and I talked the last time we were together about how finding passion could make an average person great you know why do you</p>
      <p>think that is if you love what you do first of all your work ethic is going to be fantastic because you're going to work hard if you say oh he's a hard worker man I really admire him well not really he's just enjoying himself and if you work harder than other people in your industry I'm in a very competitive when every time you buy something there's a seller on the other side so you better have done your homework particularly if he's passionate so I think a lot of is work ethic but I also think you're just going to be better at something if you enjoy it than if you don't enjoy it I've seen your golf game you love golf you're now the oldest club champion in the history of uh shinik Hills and I think I'd say 98% of that is your passion for the game well I I think passion has a lot to do with it you know I was like a 2.0 student in college but then when I got into marketing and found what I really loved everything changed and I think that's really the point that you're making you mentioned it we both play golf and there's nothing like hitting a shot that's close to the hole you hit that sweet spot what gives you that same sensation in the world of</p>
      <p>investing you know what's the thing that really keeps you addicted to what you do if you envision the future and you're wrong is not very fun it's like shank and a wedge that really matters on a keyhole but if you envision the future particularly in a way that others have not and you bet it big and it all comes to fruition it's not so much that you make a lot of money it's that you figure out a problem and you won and there's the self-satisfaction of it so constantly looking at the world as a collection of puzzles and trying to figure out those puzzles when you get them right it's wonderful when you get them wrong it's not so wonderful but you move one I also remember my mentor Spiros dris in Pittsburgh saying you get your grades in the paper every day there's no hiding in the investment business the numbers are what they are you can make up all the excuses you want at least in golf you can say it took a bad bounce or did this or that when you</p>
      <p>screw up in my business there's no hiding and the converse of that is when you do something right you have the self-satisfaction knowing you figured it out and I'll also say that while I had clients there was nothing better than making people money other than their spouse and their children you're you're a really important part of their life it's also miserable when youd have draw downs but to start with a lot of small businessmen like I did and doctors and be able to contribute to their lifestyle later on that was extremely satisfying I want to take you back Stan to your upbringing tell us a story from your childhood that really impacted the way you lead today oh that's a tough one I my parents were divorced when I was six and they split the children so I was kind of shy and withdrawn but I mean one funny story is I used to travel on the train from Richmond Virginia to Philadelphia to visit my mother and the servicemen would be on the train and I used to play poker with them and I was only like 11 years old and and I used to</p>
      <p>win and so I kind of got addictive to gambling with an edge which is what I do for a living so maybe that acted it but to be frank David I had no idea I was going to end up in the investment business I was an English major I thought it was being an English Professor then I took economics so I could read the paper intelligently then I thought I'd be an economics professor I went to graduate school I hated it so I kind of ended up in the business by default and after about three or four different things I never thought about investing on my way up in my childhood gambling yes investing no you know I had a lot of fun you know learning about you and doing my research and one of the things I learned was you didn't apply to any of the Ivy League schools I was really surprised to learn that why is that because I got 590 on my English sat boards funny because then I was dumb enough to want to become an English major my math was a lot better but I knew I just didn't have the numbers to get an IV League school the reason I applied to Bowden it was the best school</p>
      <p>in the country that didn't require SATs so I knew they wouldn't hold that against me I'd like to it hurt my confidence but I didn't have a lot of confidence going in that all developed later on when I took economics my understanding is you had your own startup when you were at Bowden you you actually started a little hot dog business what did you learn from that experience I loved it I mean you probably know this David but my partner was Larry Lindsay who ended up being the chairman of the economics under President Bush so that was kind of an odd thing but we bought a little hot dog stand and we served these guys in bath main who were the iron workers they'd come out I made the sourkraut overnight he made the chili I couldn't stand sourkraut for the rest of my life I can't even eat it now smelling it all night but it was a little bit of an entrepreneurial thing and I'm not sure what I learned from it I I enjoyed physical labor a lot more that was the only job I had before I went to the bank that wasn't physical but uh we had we had fun that's interesting because when I was in college I had a little hot dog</p>
      <p>business and you know basically you know boil the hot dogs and until they exploded we called them explodo dos you know so you mentioned earlier you you go on to get your PhD you go to Michigan but then you dropped out after two semesters why you know I loved undergraduate economics you think on the margin the Invisible Hand all that stuff graduate economics they were trying to jam the world into a mathematical equation and I just didn't think it fit I think I've been proved right on that when you look at the 800 phds at the F and their predictive record it's not so good but I didn't want to go into math I wanted to go into sort of figuring out the world and I just didn't think the world could be stuffed into a mathematical formula and the problem is these people believed their models and there was just no way so it wasn't for me I thought you actually started your career as a stock analyst but I was surprised to learn from our good friend Ken langone that your first job was as a lending officer at PNC and he he said</p>
      <p>you weren't any good at it is is that true well part of it it's true I was so bad I didn't even get the job as a lending officer so the rout to lending officer which is the job at a Commercial Bank is you go through this training program and the key to the training program is the credit part and I finished the program I thought I was pretty good and the head of credit called me in and he said look your brain is fine but in terms of being a lending officer you got to be able to sell to people and with your personality you couldn't sell snowmobiles in Alaska if there was no other form of transportation so there's a guy up on the 30th floor who runs trust department and that's more just a numbers business and maybe that's where you ought to go because I can tell you right now with your personality you just can't sell so I didn't even like fail at the job I didn't even get the job okay I didn't know that</p>
      <p>well you then get into equities and you become the head of equity research which was the number two position in The Firm you did it at the age of 25 which is hard to even fathom how did that happen so quickly Stan it's more a comment on my mentor that on me he was sort of like a mad genius and he liked to do radical things and I think there were 10 of us 10 research analysts and the other nine had mbas and I'd say their average age was between 30 and 40 and he calls me in one day and he says Stanley I'm going to make you a director research do you want to know why I go sure Mr dris and he says for the same reason they send 18y olds to War I looked at I might know what the hell he was talking about and he said yeah because they're too dumb to not to know to charge this was 1978 he said the rest of us have been in a bare market for 10 years and we got scars you can't see them but we got scars nobody here can pull the trigger and I need</p>
      <p>somebody with a fresh M that's too stupid not to know to charge cuz I think we're going to have a great bull market it's pretty good call by the way the Dow was 800 at the time and he put me in charge and that's how it happened but it was more because he liked to sort of think out of the box and break the mold I don't think a normal person would have promoted me it wasn't so much my talent is luck that had to teach you a lot and another thing I know that had to teach you a lot is that all of a sudden you're in this situation where you're managing 30 years old 40y old people you know I remember coming up and getting manage year old jobs and having older people working for me that was really hard how did you work through the anxiety of actually managing these people to the credit guy's point who said I couldn't sell snowmobiles in Alaska I'm not sure they were too thrilled with my getting the job and it got worse the guy who promoted me as I just said was a bit of a Maverick and he lost his job so now I was here all alone without a protector and I was insecure and anxious</p>
      <p>but then something really fortunate for me happened not so fortunate for some of the United States Iran took all these hostages and I'm like 26 years old I'm too dumb not to know to charge and I said well this is easy let's put 70% of our money in oil stocks and 30% of money in defense stocks and the people with more experience going what the hell you can't put 70% and 30% that's like ridiculous and frankly had I been 35 years old and had any experience I wouldn't have done it but my portfolio went up 100% And the S&P was flat because the only thing anybody wanted for the next two years were oil and defense stocks and that just kind of set me on a path where AI grain confidence and B I gained the confidence of the people in the department at 28 you decid to go out on your own you start duking Capital you're on this incredible run at PNC a very reputable Bank you seem to be</p>
      <p>kicking ass and now you leave and you start your own company what gave you the courage to go out on your own and leave that comfort zone well this an unbelievable story I'm up in New York and I'm the head of research at PNC and I'm talking one of these tout dinners you know everybody touts whatever it is they own and I give this presentation on gold and this guy comes up to me afterward and he says you don't sound like you work at a bank and I said 'w Thank you and uh he says why don't you go out on your own and I said well basically because I'm worth about 20 grand and I don't have money to go out on my own he says why don't I pay you $10,000 a month and all you have to do is talk to me and then you can try and go raise your clients on your own so I figured it was a no-brainer I'll do this and if I get fired I can go get a job like the one I have the bank was only paying me $43,000 a year and by the way I had a lot of people working for me who were paid a lot more this was back to</p>
      <p>what you mentioned earlier about me being 25 so I started this company by the way that was Joe asorio of Dale Securities who then had one of the most spectacular bankruptcies in the history of Wall Street and ended up going to jail two or three years later but that's how I got the confidence the guy just gave me you know an offer I couldn't refuse fuse what advice would you give others on how to make a move like that I think you have to weigh everything I was 28 years old I was single I looked at the risk reward the risk was there but what's the worst that can happen I'll go back and you know get another job as an analyst probably won't be a research director if you have a family and you need income which I didn't because I was all by myself it might have been a different decision but I've always been a risk taker and uh if you don't shoot for the sky you're not going to get to the sky your firm Duane Capital it just takes off what did you do to unlock value for your clients in those early years what were you looking at that most people weren't well again I</p>
      <p>got lucky not dissimilar to the Iran story vulker had just come in and all of allall street was talking about inflation going to 25% and bonds I think yielded like 14% % and nobody wanted anything to do with bonds but I watched this guy give a talk and I said oh my God this guy is a maniac and he's going to do whatever it takes to break inflation and he raised rates to like 20% and I think inflation was 12 or 13 so in my mind he was going to crush the economy he was going to crush inflation so I put 50% of all our money into 30-year bonds and the rush into cash I own no equities which was heresy and we went into a terrible recession the bonds never traded there again it was the luck of the draw because trust me David I for 30 years there were plenty of times if I</p>
      <p>had started in a different moment I would have had a bad year and I probably would have gone out of business but it was just a rocket ship particularly relative to what else was out there so it worked out well for me and then you know dyus comes along they look at you as this money-making machine you're getting these great returns and they entice you to join them and you get to continue to run your own firm you know how'd you pull that off that seemed to be an amazing fee well I just told him that's the only way he could have me I actually it was easy to go to driis because being 29 years old no one believed my record they thought it was made up and so I couldn't raise any money or maybe it goes back to the snowmobiles in Alaska story but I needed to to go to D is cu I wasn't getting the clients I had this fabulous record but for whatever reason I'd go and give a presentation and think how smart I was and then I'd always get the same call back no we're not giving you any money but the same thing happened that happened with aor a guy from dyus heard</p>
      <p>me at a at A Tout dinner and he talked Howard Stein into taking me Stein fought very very hard for me to give up Duane but I always knew I was going to end up running my own firm and I was running my own firm and it was a no-brainer for me but I just told him I wouldn't do it otherwise that's how I pulled it off I guess when you're a superstar you can do those kind of things well I wasn't really a superstar but maybe I thought I was we'll be back with the rest of my conversation with Stanley duam Miller in just a moment Stan and I both have learned so much from the great kin langone the co-founder of Home Depot Ken believes deep down and the power of people and when he joined me on the podcast we talked about helping others succeed and that's ultimately how we succeed too if we do nothing more than bring people to the realization that they're capable of so much more being a better person having solid Valu see</p>
      <p>these are all attributes that if we can Inspire them in people when you unleash that Force there's no end to where it'll end up don't miss my entire conversation with Ken langone episode 89 here on how leaders lead so you you go to dfus you take over five funds and they all do at least 40% growth it's unbelievable what was the soundtrack that was playing in your head I mean what were you telling yourself at that point in time as a teenager I wasn't very confident and now I was bringing with confidence by hindsight probably too much confidence I I think I was probably a little full of myself but I was just so in love with the business and my growth curve was learning so fast because I had now expanded into currencies and commodities I mean I cared about my performance but what I really car about is how fast I was learning and how fun the business was when was it then Stan that you teamed up with the legendary George Soros and</p>
      <p>how'd that come about good question so I read his book which apparently no no one else understood but there was a chapter in there on currencies that I found absolutely fascinating this was August of 87 about six weeks before the crash and I called him up and I said I read your book we had lunch he offered me a job at lunch I found out later he offers everybody a job and the ones that take it he then fires him shortly thereafter we started a dialogue really about daily right through the crash and it was another one of those things where I actually predicted the crash I've been wrong plenty in my career so again it was just luck he was on the wrong side of the crash so then he started making me all these ridiculous offers then the guy at dyus only paid me a million dollars and I was running five funds and one of them was number one in the entire industry so I went over to George about</p>
      <p>nine months later I had four or five sort of business mentors they all told me he was a maniac and whatever I did not to take the job but my wife told me to take the job and she was very complimentary of my skill set and again like when I started my business I figured what's the downside this guy's going to fire me in a year but then I'll still have Duan same thing I didn't give up Duan a funny story David which probably didn't find in your research I went for lunch right after I took the job at his house in Southampton and son was there and his son said congratulations you're successor number nine since he retired 6 years ago that is funny now can you tell us a story about how Soros managed people and how he held him accountable he wasn't that hard to get a job with but he was hard to keep a job with and if you didn't perform he didn't think twice</p>
      <p>about firing you and as I said I was his ninth successor I heard a couple stories of my previous successors but the most amazing one was some guy had let me say he was doing an okay job but not up to George's standards and a new guy came in who had had a spectacular success George basically just called the current guy in and said we found a better guy you're superflous now but um he treated his employees a little bit like stocks he was wonderful with me I had tough periods there draw down and he was extremely supportive when I wasn't doing well and when I was doing extremely well he was also good and he sort of like wanted to bring me down to size a little bit and when I'd start getting a big head so with me he was terrific and I had a great 12 years there I really did now I know you've told the story a million times but indulge me tell us the story of one of your most famous Investments when the Berlin Wall came down yeah so when the</p>
      <p>Berlin Wall came down the deuts mark actually got trashed for a couple days because the convention wisdom was the osmark which was the East German currency which is basically bunch of Communists was going to unite with the deark and think about it polluting this precious thing but what I saw was a labor Supply and tremendous growth ahead but with probably a lot of inflation but I had studied Germany I had studied the V our Republic I'd always been kind of fascinated with how they got to hyperinflation and I knew come H high water the bundus bank would not allow inflation and I knew partly from the chapter I had read in soros's book years before that if you have a strong economy and a central bank that is radically Raising interest rates to presentent inflation your currency is going to go up so for two or three days the deut Mark got trashed and I just kept buying</p>
      <p>it and buying it and it worked out well obviously and then over the next four or five years we made a lot more money because we shorted the Italian layer against it which broke we shorted the British pound against it which broke we shorted the Swedish croner against it so it was just a succession of waterfalls of all these currencies linked to the deut mark but their economies weren't linked to the German economy so it was a singular case of a very strong economy with a very very fanatical Central Bank and if you were linked to that currency you were kind of in a in a tough situation as a head of the hedge fund you pull the trigger on all Investments but you have analysts and Consultants working for you you know a lot of hedge fund guys that I know are reputed for being screamers you know what's your management style I learned a little bit from my first boss if you have a great performer get out of the way and let</p>
      <p>them run and then I learned from my own experience if they're having a difficult time don't scream at them be supportive I can see why Vince Lombardi is screaming at an offensive lineman why it might be effective do you think it would be effective if you had the GPS of I screamed at you every time you missed because investing is an emotional business and the last thing you want to do is berate somebody who just effectively emotionally choked which are your worst trades that's when they need your support so my management style was pretty much to try and be supportive when they were having hiccups and I would also say for 30 years in a row running that business I never went A Year Without firing anybody and we weren't a big firm so if they weren't performing we just moved on I never enjoyed firing anybody I never slept the night before but I did it if I thought it was right for the business you know I understand you quit working with Soros in the quantum Fund in 20 000 and then you went back to running decain Capital</p>
      <p>100% after taking a sabatical with your family in Africa tell us a story about how this came about what took you to that point where you needed that sabatical so in 99 the new internet stocks Yahoo uh Amazon and 10 stocks you've probably heard of but you've forgotten them because they all went bankrupt they'd gone all up about eight or tenfold the Fed was easing things had got really stupid so I shorted a basket of about 12 of these things I did not short Yahoo or AOL or the established winners and I basically took a $200 million position in the quantum fund and in one month the 200 million turned into a $600 million loss it went from 200 million to 800 million I couldn't get out so I licked my wounds and I was someone who'd been unbelievably spoiled by success so I found myself down 16% and I'd never been down more than</p>
      <p>five and I I hate to admit I was a basket case I was an emotional wreck so somehow I kind of think things through and by June or July I decide oh well the fed's going to continue easing because of Asia and Asia has nothing to do with the US other than the money will run in these stocks so now I actually embrace the bubble in all these technology stocks and I end up the year 42% but I know it's crazy so I go into Soros in January of 2000 and I said this is nuts these things are selling for like 150 times earnings the ones that even earn money and I'm selling everything and I do sell everything but then for the next six weeks the market goes straight up and I've got two kids I have hired to buy technology stocks with names I never heard of that I don't understand and they're literally making like 5% a day with a small amount of money and then I commit the cardinal sin</p>
      <p>in Money Management I get emotional and I'm watching these stocks go up every day and you know those those little cartoons the devil's on this shoulder and the devil's telling you to do it and the angels on the other shoulder and tell you don't do it don't do it well every day I want to pick up the phone and buy the market because I just can't stand that I'm missing out on this finally I do I'll never forget because it was about an hour from the top like the top of of the dot bubble and the market reverses like the next day and I know I'm wrong and a week later I'm in a whole world of hurt and I go into Soros and I go I think we've gone from like up 15% on the year to Flat in a week and I go I can't take this anymore I'm burn out I'm exhausted I said I need a break and I'm going to resign he accepted that that by the time I got out of all the stuff here we are again we're down 18%</p>
      <p>and this is May and I am a complete emotional wreck and mess so I decid to go on a sabatical and I write a letter to all my du clients say I'm going on a break I don't know when I'm coming back I can't even promise you I am coming back you can have all your money back or you can leave it in cash so what I did is I took a real break I didn't read the newspaper I didn't know where the market was I wasn't allowed to watch TV not only did I go to Africa I I would play golf and read books but nothing financial and then I came back four months later extremely refreshed I want to get to what happened after when you came back refreshed but when you're on that sabatical did you have a aha moment about your own self and your own being that that you wouldn't had if you wouldn't have taken that time alone I'm almost embarrassed to admit this it sounds so trivial but I went to an IMAX movie about Michael Jordan and I can't</p>
      <p>remember what was in the movie but somehow during that movie I decided that this was just a bump in the road and 25 years or whatever it was at the time 20 years couldn't be an accident and I needed at some point to come back to the business because it's the only thing I'm really good at and I did feel I had a special gift but for some reason I walked into that movie feeling sorry for myself and depressed and I walked out of that movie going you're so fortunate to have been given this gift and to sit here and while in your misery you ought to be ashamed of yourself and that was kind of the turning point for me and about four weeks later I went back to work so you come back to work with the fresh perspective and then what happens on the investment front then while I'm gone the S&P has rallied way back the NASDAQ has rallied way back so I pick up the newspaper and I see this and I go oh my God and then I see that the dollar is up</p>
      <p>interest rates are up and oil is up well whenever the dollar is up interest rates are up and oil is up historically that is not good looking forward so now I start calling all my clients 200 of 2011 stayed with me and all their businesses aren't doing very well either then I start calling around so there's a famous Wall Street Economist named ed Heyman so I go Ed I'm I'm shocked everything's going crazy and oil is up interest rates are up and the dollar is up and he sends me a a regression analysis with oil the dollar and interest rates and it leads S&P earnings by a year and it's predicting in a year S&P earnings are going to be down 36% and Wall Street analyst are predicting they're going to be up 18% so I short the market I buy all these treasuries betting on a recession I started the fourth quarter down 18% and had written off my record of never having a down year figured it was over wasn't trying to get even and ended up</p>
      <p>making 40% in the quarter and I will tell you had I not taken that sabatical and walled in my misel summer and try to trade my way out of it I would have missed this entire trade that I just described well I think I'm going to put a sabatical on my calendar right now how do you keep a fresh perspective today you don't take a sabatical every year how do you keep that perspective fresh today it's hard you go through a rough period I just have to keep reminding myself that this has been going on for 40 years and things will get better because I get cold you you know it in golf you see some of the greatest Putters or players in the world and they have they have terrible streaks and I still have them I would also say I'm a lot older and I'm a lot less risk averse so that kind of tempers my gains and my losses relative to back when I had clients you know I love stand to learn how leaders think in big moments and while everybody went down almost</p>
      <p>everybody went down in the financial crisis in 2008 again you made a ton of money you know how did the Stars line and how did you think through that that was pretty easy and I had a lot of con ition again I think one of the big sins of the FED which we just relived again is they tend to keep monetary policy too loose for political reasons when the punch bowl should be pulled away and by 0506 I looked at a 50-year trend line of housing which unfortunately you can't see it through a microphone but think of a steadily Rising line 3% a year with very little variance around that line for 50 years and then all of a sudden it shoots straight up in the sky for 4 five years so you're clearly in a bubble like nothing we've ever seen and then um this analyst comes into to me from Leman Brothers of all places and this is May</p>
      <p>of5 and he lays out to me their subprime calendar and he says there is no way this thing can last past the third quarter of 07 this guy's like a math genius he's got the whole schedule lined up and he says all hell's going to break loose and um I gave a speech at the Arison conference was basically plagiarizing everything he told me and predicted the whole thing and then 06 was a frustrating year David because everybody else was making a ton and I was short betting that the world was going to come to end I think I was up 5% my competitors were all up 10 or 15 but then in ' 07 when all hell broke loose we were well positioned but it was a historic bubble it was obvious just because housing prices went up for 50 years every year doesn't mean they're going to continue to go up if all the circumstances have changed people had borrowed $800 billion dollar against their homes and they were flipping them and doing all this crazy stuff it was kind of obvious and then in 2010 you</p>
      <p>decid to end your Duan capital return your client's money and invest your own money that's a huge deal big change as a leader how' you come to that decision I looked at the history of successful money managers Soros steinhardt Bruce covner some of my Idols by the time they hit late 50s they're kind of burned out it doesn't make any sense I know why a golfer is better at 28 than 58 but you would think with all this wisdom you'd be a better investor but you lose your risk appetite or your enthusiasm or your ability to work as hard I don't know what it was but I could see that I was not the manager I was 15 or 20 years ago and I was starting to lose it and frankly ego wise I was worried about destroying a great record and I became obsessed with the fact that I never had a down year and wasn't willing to take the risk I should be taken because that should have absolutely nothing to do with any trading you make and it was time it was</p>
      <p>30 years I didn't want to compete anymore I want to I want the intellectual satisfaction stimulation but not the fire of competition that I once had how do you look at competitions Dan well as you know because you know me I'm I'm overly competitive I know it it's a sickness it's a disease but it's not one I can cure I'm I'm born with it and I just kind of Channel it and realize that I'm sick and and that I'm an overly competitive person and I try and work around and and do the best but it obviously has its advantages everyone's always said to me what makes a great money manager and they're always astonished with my first answer I said they're all overly competitive it's like that's rule number one which goes along with the passion you mentioned earlier because they're passionate about competing they're passionate about the business you openly tell others that you have a bearish sometimes pessimistic mindset how do you manage that when it comes to the decisions you make well I just have to know my own bias so</p>
      <p>I'm constantly fighting my bearishness about the world and one of the great hedge fund managers of all time Bob Wilson the greatest short seller ever he said he made 90% of his money on the long side the math just works against you if you're perfect on a short you can double your money but if you're wrong on a short you can lose 10 times your money if you're dead wrong and along you lose your money but if you're right you can make 10 times your money and it's a mathematical inverse of that with shorting and I you don't have to be a rocket scientist I know therefore that if you have a bearish bias you have to be very aware of it and you have to work around it and I always have you've got a real strong self-awareness of what your strengths in areas of opportunity might be what advice can you give to others on how to build that self-awareness because a lot of people kind of put their head in they're saying on their own being these successful people have all failed they learn from their failures probably the most famous commencement speech ever with Steve Jobs speech at Stanford when</p>
      <p>he talked about failure and I would just say that a admit that you've had failures and then go back and analyze those failures and why they happened and learn from them the people that aren't self-aware look self-aware people like myself and I do think I'm self-aware I've had a lot of failures but I use them to learn from as opposed to pretend they didn't happen if you pretend they didn't happen they're going to keep repeating themselves so I would say that's the main thing is admit your failures and then learn from their failures you know I recall eight or nine years ago that you toured college campuses urging reform in taxation Health Care Social Security why did you feel compelled to do that and what did you learn from getting out there with the students that was the most incredible experience look I knew since 1994 because I looked at the demographics of the baby boom and I looked at what our government was doing</p>
      <p>that we're going to have a problem sometime between say 2020 and 2030 so this was like 15 or 20 years before that that when the Baby Boomers turn 65 you're going to have all these people not earning any money anymore but collecting Social Security Medicare all this stuff so so I knew we had a math problem I waited until when I did because the spending boom that occurred after 1994 alarmed me the most amazing thing David was I started at Bowden I went to really liberal places like brown Berkeley and then I went to places like North Carolina USC Notre Dame I thought I was going to get absolutely annihilated at the leftwing places and the students all loved it they were all like insanely in favor of it and they got it because I presented the picture that we're not talking about just paying seniors we're talking about instead of calling them young people future seniors</p>
      <p>not having any money so they can enjoy retirement so it was more about a wealth transfer and then I showed them how the government had started the internet they'd started GPS and the government wasn't making any of these kind of Investments anymore cuz they were all going to transfer payments but the most shocking thing to me was just how incredible the students were but it was kind of like and this is not shocking to me because I was in college once too it lasted for a couple days you know you get them all worked up in the meeting but then there's no follow through and then of course four years later it was very discouraging because the only thing Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump agreed on was we can't touch entitlements and now you got Biden screaming about entitle almost like you're going to be screwing old people you're not going to be screwing old people you're going to be screwing future old people but no one frames it properly Stan you still took that time you still went out to all these colleges you know what made you do it I what</p>
      <p>compelled you to do it you had a great story you wanted them to hear but why did you as Stanley dram Miller say I got to take this upon myself and and get out there and get this message there I don't know you remember I was a failed English professor and a failed economics professor I wanted to teach and I felt I had a particular Insight here I love America and we just can't keep doing this and you keep eating your seed corn eventually it's going to hit one day and I just saw this tsunami coming 10 to 15 years ahead so far it hasn't hit by the way the fundamentals that I outlined they've all gotten worse what bailed you out was Zero interest rates don't matter how much debt you have if you're not paying anything on the debt no one cares it will be very interesting if the fed and rates do go to 4 four a half here because the bills that I talked about they assumed a 4% interest rate that's why it hasn't hit yet it's because rates weren't four they were zero but I'm I'm</p>
      <p>more concerned about it than I've ever been I just felt I had an obligation to ring the bell for other people listen to I rang it they didn't care so I went back to my hole well people do listen to what you have to say you know we've talked about this already we both love golf but I also know that you happen to be a huge Pittsburgh Steelers fan which I know you almost bought the Pittsburgh Steelers could you tell us that story I guess um Pittsburgh has always been a love affair with me I moved there right after Michigan it was a bluecollar town there was a work ethic there and a workingman thing that kind of appealed to me and when 2008 hit I was worried about the city and I thought it would be tremendous a I'm passionate about the Steelers I'm passionate about the city but um the man who really made the franchise Dan Rooney who was Art the chief's son he was dead set against it and he didn't want it to happen and all</p>
      <p>sorts of forces that were put in place and it got messy and you know I didn't really want it that bad I could have had it but it all worked out because the minute I withdrew um Uber Microsoft Google they've all moved to Pittsburgh and carnegi melon is sort of like a mini Stanford so Pittsburgh is doing [Music] tremendously I believe every great leader must have a plan to get better in fact I think it's so important that I actually send out a weekly leadership plan each week the plan focuses on a different leadership topic and gives you actionable steps you can take to develop that skill on a practical level think about it like a leadership development program only it's simple no fluff practical skills will help you lead your team to success you can get free access at how leaders lead.com slpl that's how leaders lead.com</p>
      <p>slpl Stan I've learned you've been successful by following a number of Concepts and I'd like to talk about a few of them just get a quick snapshot of how you think about these things I've called them drug nuggets okay and nugget number one is do not invest in the present give me a for instance I learned this way back in the 70s from my mentor dris I was a chemical analyst so when should you buy chemical companies traditional Wall Street is when their earnings are great well you don't want to buy them when their earnings are great because what do they do when their earnings are great they go out and expand capacity into a bunch of capital spending and then three or four years later there's overc capacity and they're losing money um what about when they're losing money well then they stop building capacity so three or four years later capacity will have shrunk and their profit margins will be way up so you always have to sort sort of imagine the world the way it's going to</p>
      <p>be in 18 to 24 months as opposed to now if you buy it now you're buying into every single fad every single moment whereas if you envision the future you again try and imagine a world how that might be reflected differently in security prices nugget number two put all your eggs in one basket and watch it very carefully well that's a playism of of Mark but absolutely if you look at all the really great investors from Warren Buffett Soros to Icon they don't have 200 Big positions they take massive positions in something they really believe in or think about this Ken langone with Home Depot it's not a law that he needed to keep owning Home Depot but he knew Home Depot really well he knew what he had so that's what he did or Jeff Bezos he does need to own all that Amazon but he could have Diversified at any point so if you know something really well and you believe in</p>
      <p>it and I also say it imparts discipline if you have massive positions in something you're not going to have what they call in my industry lazy Longs where you're not really paying attention and you get blindsided if you got a position that's really going to hurt you when it goes down human nature you're going to watch that thing much more carefully Dru nugget number three if you have an idea invest quickly study it more later I think I stole a phrase from Soros even though I was already doing it he called it invest and then investigate and that's become much more true as time has gone by because when I got in the industry two people in my class of Bowden went to Wall Street in 75 by 2000 most of the hot shots in the ivy league we're going to Wall Street so things have gotten much more competitive information's gotten much more competitive it's gotten quicker we got the internet so if you get an idea and</p>
      <p>you wait two or three weeks while you're analyzing it to death a lot of times the stock will already move during those two or three weeks and then God forbid you're paralyze you can't buy it because you saw the stock at 100 and now it's 150 so if I have a good concept I buy it do my work and if it done work out if my concept was wrong I get rid of it because we're in a world of very very fast moving information and security prices reflect it you also believe another drug nugget is that you need to be looking at leading and lagging Industries you were one of the first to really take that approach to investing talk about that one my macro approach to the economy has always been looking at businesses as opposed to statistics like unemployment figures or all the stuff that the phds look at so if you got a business like housing that leads or retail that's coincident or Trucking that leads I have found that if you get</p>
      <p>into management and even one level down from Top management and you talk about the trends and if all those leading Industries are really really strong the econom is probably about to turn up and do very well and vice versa if housing is weakening and trucking is weakening usually the economy is not going to have a good future you know and and I love this druck nugget be imaginative around what could go wrong what's your process for doing that Dr my first boss dellis what's obvious is obviously wrong and it's already reflected in security prices this kind of goes back to the invest in the present if everything is Rosy it's already in the stock price and already in the market there's nobody left to buy so you have to constantly be a evaluating what could go wrong but I'll turn that on its head you also have to evaluate what could go right and it's not an accident that almost every stock market bottom happens during a recession</p>
      <p>and during lousy earnings and every top happens with consumer confidence High not low the world changes and you're only going to pick up change if you're opening your mind up to how things could be different whether it's better or worse another nugget just watching what you've done is you're very dispassionate about your decisions and that's hard for me to really fathom because I'm a pretty emotional guy and you get so focused on your decision yet you can like change your mind in a hurry look I feel the emotion so don't think I'm like dispassionate I feel the emotion but I've learned through experience just move on and so yeah I would say in actions I'm extremely cold-blooded for an investor but trust me I'm feeling inside it's sort of like watching Patrick kley play golf he looks like his own autopilot and he doesn't care I would guess a lot that that yes that young man is feeling it but if if you</p>
      <p>can control your actions as opposed to what you're feeling that's the only thing that matters you know I want to shift gears a little bit just talk about what's going on today you know because I I think everybody would kill me if I didn't ask you a year ago you predicted the high inflation we have right now and that the markets would correct and and you were right once again what do you predict in the next few years yeah let me start by saying the cold emotion we just talked about I changed my mind a lot so it's always dangerous for anybody to listen to me because I can be in love with something on Friday and then on Wednesday I'm actually short it and there said well Dr said this or that so that's qualifier number one qualifier number two is probably more important right now we've never seen an environment where you had the Gap we have now between monetary policy and inflation and a lot of my gig is to go back and find Historical analoges and see how they worked out and learn from them this is the most</p>
      <p>unprecedented cocktail I've ever been served up so I have more humility than I've ever had in terms of a fore class in fact my positions reflect that they're very light not because I'm scared just because I can't see a fat pitch I can't figure it out we've borrowed so much from our future and with corporate profits at an all-time high here and interest rates presenting a challenging situation it's just hard for me to Envision that we might not be ending the secular bull market you know on TV I heard a guy this morning morning say but I'm really bullish on the long term I'm actually not really bullish on the long term I mean anything could happen over 18 or 24 months but what I'm worried about is like a 68 to 82 period where you go up and down three or four times but you basically go nowhere I don't know whether that's enough of a Dodge but that's my answer you know one of the things you said that I thought was really interesting that</p>
      <p>after we had the recession in 2008 he said that it would take about 4 years for us to have something like this happen again but you know that old Dolly Parton song Here We Go Again I mean it happened a lot earlier than what you might have imagined why do you think that is well what I was talking about was a financial crisis and to be fair we haven't had another one yet but it's a great question because the reason it takes so long between crisises is because the public learns from the catastrophe and they get what Drell is called scars and it takes them a long time to screw it up again but beri threw so much Firepower at the thing and then oddly for the next 10 years when it wasn't really necessary the FED has continued to throw Firepower at the thing so instead of taking 30 or 40 years for people to get there speculative juices all turned on</p>
      <p>again zero rates for 10 or 11 years has said up a potentially dangerous situation that I could have never imagined 10 years ago we'd be in this position but it's basically the policy response has been unrelenting we've never had a policy response like this in fact banki bragged about the fact that the policy response in the 30s was and I applaud what he did in ' 0809 but the fact that we've continued to use emergency measures until the last nine months when there was no emergency every big economic problem I've ever seen is preceded by an asset bubble 29 here 89 in Japan 07 here in housing so to have a really big problem you need an asset bubble and these guys created the biggest asset bubble I've ever studied in the last five or six years crypto mem stocks equities credit bonds this isn't necessarily going to happen but that's</p>
      <p>why I'm scared we've got what is basically a G2 economy now the US on one side China on the other how do you see that playing out well the answer is I don't know but I think G doesn't understand what made China Great the last 20 or 30 years which was dun sha ping moving toward free market reforms letting these entrepreneurs flourish this common Prosperity thing and going back to maoism and communism I'm not as high on them as an economic threat as the consensus I am concerned that they're a geopolitical threat as an autocracy that's building a lot of military but the economy they seem to be moving in all the right directions pre and they seem to be moving in all the wrong directions now so I'd say relative to consensus they remind me not as extreme but a little bit of all the predictions that the Soviet Union was going to surpass us in the 60s and Japan was going to surpass Us in the 80s I still</p>
      <p>think despite all our problems we have a good chance of remaining the king of the hell besides being so renowned as an investor you've been widely recognized as one of the most giving people in the world you co-founded the Harlem's Children Zone tell us how that cause touched your heart and how it came about well like you David I've been lucky enough to live the American dream and I believe in the American dream but when I joined the Robin Hood board in New York City it became quickly apparent that the American dream's not open to I'd say 5% of our population there are these pockets in these inner cities and these neighbors they even have to be in inner city they've got some in Kentucky that aren't in the inner city as you know and I just passionately would like to help that not be the case and when I met Jeff k Canada I knew he was maybe the most extraordinary leader and person I'd ever met within an hour and he came up with a dream of the</p>
      <p>Harlem Children Zone which was kind of level the playing field for central Harlem not guaranteed outcomes but guaranteed opportunities so these kids would have a chance to have a shot and that's why it touched my heart that's great and you and your family you've been just a huge investor and you know looking for the cures to cancer and where we've made a lot of progress and you're also big time into Neuroscience seeking a cure for Alzheimer's and Dementia what do you see happening on that front so cancer we're already moving rapidly up the scurve and I think the discoveries in cancer cure the next 10 or 15 years are going to blow your mind they've already been amazing the last 10 years we had basically shooting chemo into people for 50 years and then 10 or 15 years ago we figed figured it out and we got AI we got genetic sequencing we got immunotherapy so I'm very bullish near and intermediate term</p>
      <p>on cancer cures Neuroscience think the S curve but you're still down on the bottom part before it rises but it's sort of the Last Frontier of the brain between um Alzheimer's Parkinson's ALS and I just believe in human Ingenuity I see the science that's being applied there and we have invested a lot in basic research and we talked a lot earlier about failure you got to fail at basic research for a long time before you get the solutions but I believe that Neuroscience is probably 10 or 15 years behind cancer and that hopefully in 20 or 25 years we'll be seeing in these brain things the kind of thing we just talked about with cancer well thanks for everything you're doing on both those fronts and S this has been awesome it's been a lot of fun and and I want to have some more with my lightning round of Q&A are you ready for this probably not what are three words that others would use to describe you abrupt um</p>
      <p>dry and uh I'd say competitive if you could be one person for a day beside yourself who would it be in why probably Jeff Bezos 5 years ago before he went on the benjis on now cuz I think he invented the greatest company I've seen in my lifetime and uh brought so much change to so many of our Lives what's your biggest pet peeve I would say what's happening and I hope it's temporary with the work ethic and the culture in the United States postco what would you be if you weren't an investor a failure my my mother-in-law says I'm an idiot savan and I totally agree with her what's something about you few people would know probably that I have you know exem bouts of uh emotional anxiety in terms of my investing career what's one word you'd use to describe being a parent just Joy what's one word you'd use to</p>
      <p>describe being a grandparent more joy that's two words Dan that your best golf coach in why well I'm going to cheat and give you two but Phil riton I needed major heart surgery and he started from the bottom of it took me but if if you're even a decent golfer there's nobody like Butch Harmon your predicted 2022 Pittsburgh Steeler record nine and seven if you could boil your superpower down to one word what would it be I would say Drive Stan you've made so many decisions what do you think is the most important decision you've ever made oh not even close when I married Fiona unbelievable partner unbelievable mother I have Smart children because of her she keeps me grounded you know I think both of us have been blessed and we have incredible families and in different ways you know</p>
      <p>we've experienced high levels of wealth what advice can you give to people who have been blessed from a monetary standpoint on how to raise your kids and your grandkids my wife and I couldn't have disagreed more and everything to do with the home she wins and she did not hold back on giving them material things but what she did do was spend an unbelievable amount of time with them and one of the things I bristle at is people that say they spend quality time with their children to me raising children is all about quantity not quality and if you're with them and youve just let by example you don't need to lecture them but if you're with them a lot they'll get it and I don't know how she pulled it off but I've got three overachieving children with high integrity and values and I wouldn't have done a thing she did and I'd say that's</p>
      <p>the number one I've L learned just spend as much time as you can with your children how do you do that Stan you we're talking earlier about tout meetings you have to go to and all you know you could spend your whole life going to all these meetings and how did you get that time with your kids because I know you made that a huge priority I didn't get enough but first of all my wife when our kids were young gave up her job until they were older so she spent tremendous amount of time with them one of my mentors in life Sam Reeves told me the best thing you can do if you have more than one child is spend one-on-one time with each child because they're always competing that was helpful and because I had a decent amount of money by the time I was say 42 or 43 and I had my kids at 35 or 36 I was able to spend a lot of time with them on the weekends but you know you just make your priorities I had an English teacher who said to me when we had our children just remember it all happens in the first five years and if</p>
      <p>you screw it up you're going to pay for it the rest of your life and if you get it right you're going to be rewarded the rest of your life and even after the first five you're only with those kids like 17 years it's only a fifth of your life life so during those 17 years you got to try and pack everything you can in I know it's hard but you really do that's great advice and we've talked about our great mentor and friend Ken langone the co-founder of Home Depot he's been an important Mentor in your life what's the biggest thing you've learned from him the amazing thing about Ken and I haven't learned it because I can't execute on the way he does is he just every day that man wakes up and want to make himself a better person he just wants to keep learning and keep improving and he's 87 years old and in my opinion he represents Perfection but he's in improved mode every day of his life he's striving to be a better person another person you mentioned just a few minutes ago is Sam Reeves you know he was the king of cotton commod training</p>
      <p>you know he's just sort of like I call him the most interesting man in the world you know like those those seis commercials but what's something he's taught you just an unbelie bable parent and grandparent and also he so-called retired 20 or 30 years ago he has kept himself very disciplined about maintaining intellectual stimulation I don't care whether it's biotechnology or investing or world events or parenting or even what's new in golf that man he is just the me of never giving up in terms of pushing himself intellectually and then few people know that when Jimmy Dunn lost his firm in 911 you walked him home every night you were with him when he needed you most tell us about that experience I don't know whether I walked him home every night that's probably an embellishment but he's just one of the most extraordinary leaders human beings I've</p>
      <p>ever met and here again we talked about priorities about children early on and setting things aside I mean he he had just gotten to the point in his career when I think he thought he could play a lot of golf and he was ready for a transition and Bam that thing hit and that man gave up everything he did like 200 eulogies he met with those families and the way he dug deep when a lot of people could have felt sorry for themselves and it was just all go with Jimmy and he impacted so many lives but I think he would agree as horrible as that was to go through he's probably a lot better man now than one could have ever imagined pre it happening he took strength from adversity and that's really the measure of a human last but not least I know another good poers is is Zed hurle he's a great friend and adviser what's he taught you well Ed's just smarter than the rest of us and uh the thing about Ed is he he doesn't need</p>
      <p>to wear his success or his brains on his sleeve and he's very quiet about what he does but he's got a hidden aggression and I say that in the highest complimentary ways he's so understated relative to the impact he has on people's lives and frankly on American Business it's just it's all inspiring I couldn't agree more and Stan Wendy and I we watched your interviews on YouTube and and afterwards she said we need Stan to run for president and I said why why would you think that and she answers well he's smart he tells it like it is he's a better Communicator than I thought he was and he's always been really nice to me well s what do you think drug for president I have sleep apne I'd probably be about where Biden is in about six months Stan you are in all seriousness you are a great American a great guy every s of the world and I I want to</p>
      <p>thank you for taking the time to have this conversation it means a lot to me and uh it's it's been really special I had so much fun getting to know you better uh by getting to do this it was a lot of fun and uh I appreciate you're doing it hopefully we had some impact on some [Music] people boy I just love how Stan sees the world he's got such an incredible mind and we all learn that he's even got a more incredible heart he's unlike anyone else out there and you know he sees the future unlike anybody else too and that's been a major driver of his unrivaled success in the investment World he's always learning and seeing patterns and then he's bold enough to trust that thinking and take a big swing like Stan if you can anticipate trends before everyone else you'll have an incredible opportunity to capitalize on it the problem for us is we get so</p>
      <p>wrapped up in the urgency of the present that we don't give oursel the proper space to Envision the future so let's fix that this week grab coffee or lunch with a trusted colleague at your company and just have a conversation about the future of your industry in the next 18 to 24 months what are your bold predictions what can you see that others might miss what actions can you take to leverage those opportunities when you make it a habit to think about the future in this way you'll give yourself a really rare competitive Advantage because you know what most people just don't do it so do you want to know how leaders lead what we learned today is the great leaders see the future differently coming up next on how leaders lead is Brian Cornell the chairman and CEO of Target how do you manage your energy how do you train like you're an athlete and transfer some of that learning from tennis and golf and football and baseball into the corporate environment how do you make sure that</p>
      <p>you're at your best when you have to be at your best so be sure to come back again next week to hear our entire conversation thanks again for tuning in to another episode of how leaders lead where every Thursday you get to listen in while I interview some of the very best leaders in the world I make it a point to give you something simple on each episode that you can apply to your business so that you will become the best leader you can [Music] be</p>

      <h2>8. Stanley Druckenmiller Explains How He Makes 30% Return Every Year</h2>
      <p class="source-link"><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELlmZ7WAMgU" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELlmZ7WAMgU</a></p>
      <div class="transcript-body">
      <p>almost one in every four children in the united states of america lives in a state of poverty that's an outrage one way to think about it of the top 35 industrial countries in the world we have the second highest poverty rate stan druckenmiller is here for 30 years he maintained one of the best investment track records on wall street he recently orchestrated a campaign at colleges across the country to educate and mobilize action on entitlement reform and other government spending he says that without a major overhaul soon today's young people will be robbed of the future benefits and standard of living they deserve i am pleased to have stan drucamilla at this table welcome thanks charlie good to see you it's good to see you can i just start with understanding you you know this remarkable record uh with duquesne and and with quantum fund and george soros and the relationship you did you you where are you in your life</p>
      <p>you mean what am i doing yeah i'm still managing money very actively for family or for family and the family foundation right so i go to work about six and i come home at six so i'm doing that 12 hours a day i'm still in love with markets the only thing that's changed is i'm not competing anymore so i'm not managing other people's money but i love markets and i love the intellectual challenge as much as i ever have is that what you love about marcus the intellectual challenge yes also i'm i like talking i i like no not so much being rich as i like to win i have a disease it's a competitive disease that i it gives me a thrill to win but but does it give you a thrill also to win and to be better than someone else which is winning well i don't know whether you're better than someone else but gives me a thrill to have better results than someone else yes um and and where did you get that that where does the competitive spirit</p>
      <p>come from do you know you can't remember when you didn't have it i don't know i remember being a brat when i was little we used to play board games at our house constantly and uh i really did not like to lose when i play board games and uh just something i was born with it's a it's somewhat of a curse but it also has its advantages in terms of pushing you to perform yeah and pushing and therefore and with success uh widening your opportunities to do a range of things yes yes but but beyond that what is it about markets that's magical for people who love the idea of what they not only represent but the challenge they offer yes so i'd say there's two things number one i love trying to put a puzzle together visualize the future and particularly if you have a different view than other people and if you do that right the security prices in the future will reflect that and there's there's a great satisfaction</p>
      <p>to having solved that puzzle and the nice thing is you get your grades in the paper every day there's no subjectivity in the money management business it's right there and if you're screwing up yeah those numbers every day yeah and i i love the objectivity of that i always have george soros and and the relationship the two of you had i mean because you were there you were the guy when the great decision based on the devaluation of the pound happened yes right you bet right yes and you bet a lot yes and you made a billion dollars plus on one day something like that yes or something like that you know precisely okay true so who has the the who has abused a polite term who has the there's a bigger nerve you were george oh i'd say george ice water george has more ice water than i do um i'd say if if you looked at our records are they're very comparable when he ran</p>
      <p>quantum and iran quantum they're they're almost within decimal points and i'd say george made more spectacular vets and my record was a little more the bets were more consistent but the results were pretty much the same but do you agree with them in terms of that you know if you see an opportunity just go all in oh yeah if there's one thing i learned from george and what made me a better money manager because of george it's exactly that it's not whether you're right or wrong it's how much money you make when you write and how much you lose when you're wrong yeah so and how confident you are that you're right yes but up until that point i had a very good record but it was only after i was with george that i learned how much you should really press a bet when your confidence level is extremely high i did find where before i was there don't get me wrong but but it was amazing to watch that man when we had something we really believed in um to to see the way he would</p>
      <p>he would size risk and reward yeah and you cherish the fact that the relationship is one in which as i ask you when you sat down you know we're friends uh we have different lives but he once said you know you're not only a great money manager but you're also a partner no i'm i have very fond feelings with george's best 12 years of my life my three children were born i learned a lot it was an exciting time and you know we're we're still in touch we're on different political sciences that's exactly where i was going there's been a build up to that it doesn't matter in terms of our friendship at all totally different places aren't you yes but the respect is there so i mean maybe washington could learn something because we couldn't be different politically but i think the mutual respect is there so so define how you're different politically i think george um in traditional terms he would consider be considered more on the left right</p>
      <p>and i would be considered more on the right particularly on the non-social issues on the economic issues he's much more pro-regulation he thinks markets go wild i love free markets i'm anti-regulation yeah and are you beyond being on the right more libertarian yeah i think that's probably fair yes i'm certainly not on the right on social issues and i'm certainly anti-crony capitalism so i have some strange views um in terms of being on the right that normal corporations may not particularly particularly like a lot of views that normal corporation may not like lots of them don't you i mean sure i'm sure everybody does and that's why we want to go through this but i mean i what was surprising me actually i think that to understand what you're arguing for is is not necessarily predictable from where you come through from politically oh no that's absolutely true in fact</p>
      <p>i think one of the problems of getting this message through which is so obvious to me it's as obvious as the pound was and then some in terms of predictability it has a longer time frame is that it has been associated with austerity and the right wing and i don't look at it that way at all when i heard it i think in many ways the left wing should be more excited or as excited as the right wing and that's actually what we found out on the road with the students the kids at berkeley loved it the kids at brown loved it so it's the same conclusion but it's a different messaging okay uh i mean i think i wanted to set this up so that we can have you then explain to me what it is that you're on the road talking about and what this and and what is the central idea and why you're so passionate about it uh but i wanted to understand where you come from politically from the right maybe more libertarian but and and at the same time the enormous respect you i'm an independent who would be considered</p>
      <p>center on social issues and probably you know somewhere very much opposed to the present administration well i voted for him the first time first time uh but i've been opposed to just about everything he's done since i voted for him yes what was your problem with health care my problem with health care we talked about obamacare yes i believed it was a once in a generation opportunity to separate this thing from the corporation and make the consumer of health care actually have choice and have skin in the game i think one of the big problems with health care system is we go to the doctor we have no incentive to shop we have no incentive to see what the costs are and as long as your corporation is paying the bills and you don't see that bill that's the way it's going to remain i guess there's no therefore intelligence at the choice at the decision point right there there's none whatsoever or self-interest</p>
      <p>right we we have taken away the market which you could use very much so to solve this problem we've completely taken out of the equation i guess my problem with obamacare the more i s the more i understand now is it's all dishonest and by that i mean so we're taking young healthy people and making them buy plans with stuff in them they don't need to subsidize people with preconditions and older people and unless you do that the system will not work and i'm okay if you want to tax stan druckenmiller and you want to tell him we're taxing you to support people with pre-existing conditions and sick people i'm not okay with messing up all this marketing and making me have maternity and all kinds of stuff in there is some kind of hidden scheme to make that subsidization if we as a society want to choose to</p>
      <p>to implement universal health care the way they want let's at least be honest about it and let's just put a tax on all of us and say we choose to do this let's not do something you're going to pay that kind of tax uh would i be willing to pay for it i'd feel a lot better paying for it as a tax than mucking up the whole incentives within the health care system would i be willing to pay for it yes i think i would so you're going around to college campuses and you have a central theory which i referred to in the introduction which is that is that you are you believe that it's terribly unfair what we are doing to young people today that we're burdening them with circumstances that we didn't have so that they can take care of us yes that's very simplified so you expand so the way our entitlement system works is it's not pay as you go it was set up a long time ago so current workers</p>
      <p>pay for current seniors right and because of the senior lobby versus young people because young people don't vote and they don't give money to parties they have other things on their mind and are not organized the seniors in our society have been taking an increasing share for the better part of 40 years from money allotted to youth and investment and this this is somewhat alarming has been somewhat alarming but now is extremely alarming because the baby boom which took place from 1947 to 1967 and that was 65 years ago means the number of seniors is about to explode so the share of the pie that has gone to the elderly is now about to be distributed to a lot more people specifically charlie we are creating 8 000 new</p>
      <p>seniors on the entitlement payrolls every day now that's because of the demographics and we're only producing two thousand young adult workers to support them that number goes to eleven thousand by two thousand and twenty nine so you have a combination of too much pie going to one sector and now that sector growing dramatically relative to the sector that's going to support them which should set up a big fiscal problem sometime in the next 20 to 40 years i guess what's different about not in the next 10 or 15. i don't think in the next 10 or 15 but i don't know but let me tell you why i don't care if it's in the next 10 or 15 because every day we wait is money that the next generation has to pay whether it's 10 or 15 or whether it's 20 or whether it's 30 or whether it's 40. every day you wait and and these obligations and these promises and these debts accumulate means</p>
      <p>that the next generation will pay that bill as opposed to seniors today so there's a there's a terrible unfairness about about what we're looking at today and as you probably know one of the problems is we are allocating more and more resources toward transfer payments to senior and away from things like head start nih grants investments in education so you're also having the seed corn eating problem okay so okay there are lots of things that come out of all this number one i hear you you know and and i think other people recognize the the problem we face you know and and but you're raising you're basically saying to young people uh you got to do something you got to get organized you have to take it in your responsibility otherwise you're going to face a crushing burden uh yes they're going to and you will have to pay more and they won't you'll get you'll have to pay more and you won't get out as much because people who are older are getting out what they were promised</p>
      <p>yes one of the things i thought one of the things i bristle at is that i've read in some of these things that i'm anti-entitlement yeah well i'm going to get at that that's what i'm doing i'm not anti-entitlement i want youth today to enjoy the benefits of the social security net and the and that retirees today enjoy and if we continue to share the pie the way we're doing it there's going to be nothing left in for the youth of today so it's not that i'm anti-entitlement it's that i'm for sustainability of entitlement because those who stand up to say look just it we just got to let the baby boom generation get through the system and then we can figure all this out well that's where my day job comes in and that's where that is total nonsense because what happens is that's the rat through the python theory once the rat goes through the python you're fine by the time the 20 or 30 years are up when the baby booms are over the debt is so high that the interest payments alone start to become bigger than the entitlements were during the 20 to 30</p>
      <p>years are you at all encouraged over the fact that the debt is going down and that none whatsoever you see that is temporary you see that is small you see that that's tiny potatoes that's just um a short-term cyclical phenomena that has nothing to do with entitlements nothing this we are right on the front end of a demographic surge that is going to cause investment spending to go crazy let me just put in perspective for you so the next 10 years okay and this is with the administration's optimistic budget the growth the growth not the spending the growth in social security medicare and medicaid is going to be 780 billion dollars the growth in spending on children is going to be 20 billion dollars okay that's what you're looking at now i don't know what kind of society you want but this is just transfer payments to the elderly who as i mentioned earlier have already been increasing their share</p>
      <p>of the pie for the last 40 years i think it's unfair most of all and secondly it will set up an unsustainable situation down the road we can't afford it so here's the alternative argument too when you look at this as you've heard before take larry summers somebody who's i'm sure intellect you have some respect for uh argues that all the talk about entitlement reform you know and someone understands down the road the fears that you're that you are pointing to says what we need to do is create growth in the economy and that the growth in the economy will take care of all the problems that stan is worried about okay so a it won't take care of all the problems i'm talking about b i'm very sympathetic simplifying it a little bit i'm very sympathetic to what larry is saying who i consider a friend so let me just throw i hate to get too numbery here okay but let me just so 40 years ago and this is an argument larry would be</p>
      <p>very sympathetic to 40 years ago we spent 32 percent of federal outlays on investment government investment that would include things like infrastructure education r d science exploration and we spent about 30 on transfer payments to the elderly we now spend 68 on transfer payments but investments are down to 15 percent so i think to larry's point what did we get out of the investment well we got the internet we got gps we got the human genome so that's where you agreement that out of i totally agree and if you look at the sequester that the investments are worthwhile and important and crucial to our future yes but we are cutting the investments so we can continue to let transfer payments to the elderly grow at a very rapid rate we cannot do both or or we're cutting the investments because we do not have a realistic look at where</p>
      <p>uh of taxes which you're prepared to have a realistic look at yes in other words you're not coming here as a as a representative sort of a view often expressed by the 30 members of congress although you had some reservations obviously about the health fund defunding the health care even though you expressed reservations about it your point was that you did not as i understand where you are you you didn't you thought they were silly maybe to use your own words to try to attach defunding to medicare to the debt ceiling on the other hand you'd be prepared to attach something else to raising the debt ceiling in order to have some sanity uh to address the problem you're talking about am i right or wrong an interpretation i was 100 against tying obamacare to a government is defunding obamacare yeah i was 100 together right that argument was decided and as much as i didn't like the conclusion i have never been for defunding obamacare once it was voted for and certainly linking it to government to the government shutdown was insane</p>
      <p>are there circumstances in which you would think a government shutdown you know is is satisfactory if in fact and for example say we'll shut down the government uh rather than raise the debt ceiling if i thought there was a big enough carrot and to me that would be entitlement serious entitlement reform right at the end of the road i would be willing to flirt with a government shutdown there was no big carrot at the end of the road both parties agreed the one thing we weren't going to do is cut growth in payments to seniors we weren't even talking about entitlements we were talking about other things well basically we're talking about obamacare the president said that he the president said whether you believe him or not that they're certainly prepared that's what the budget process is about right now is that you prepare to look at some changes in entitlement reform in contrast to changing the tax structure and the spending the president says a</p>
      <p>lot of things the first thing that set me on my media tour and the college tour was the president when the budget battle started way back in the beginning of last year stated i saw it on television it was like yesterday the one thing we are not going to do is balance this on the back of seniors right that was his initial position and by the way i haven't heard a lot different from how do you want to balance it on the back of scene okay so this is where my role as a philanthropist and my day job intersect right all right so we cut head start up in harlem right we're cutting nih grants where i am at sloan kettering right but we're not even touching this other stuff so this is what this is so then that brings us to this point how would you touch the other stuff okay so that's the point yes now i'm going to give you an answer but the first thing i think that's also a larry's point to a degree but when talking about i'm going to give you an answer but the first thing i want to say</p>
      <p>is the first thing i've been trying to do is identify the problem right i don't have a monopoly on the truth so i have my own opinions and i have some suggestions but i really think the answer to your question needs to be fought out in the political arena if you're asking me for what my suggestions would be the first thing we'd have to do is the really low hanging fruit you can means test to a greater extent medicare you can certainly means test social security we haven't even done that okay so people like you who don't need medicare would not get medicare correct i would look at it philosophically this was an insurance safety net we paid into 40 or 50 years we bought fire insurance the fire didn't happen let's give the let's give the insurance to the people that need it okay but that's not a whole lot of money okay i guess where i also differ even from the republicans is i would not exempt people over 55. when i look at the share of the pie that the current seniors have gotten the last</p>
      <p>40 years the chain weighted cpi that wouldn't even go far enough i would freeze the thing freeze it in terms of social security now i will say 30 or 40 of the people really need social security and this is where the means testing come in they should be provided for i do not want to see seniors in positive in poverty i also don't want to say you don't see things without medical care you don't want to see seniors with it with all the things that they thought they had a social contract to receive yes and they're receiving it okay then you get into the elephant in the room which is a health care system and here it gets very complicated but let me let me just say that the first thing you've got to do is put incentives at the consumption level and it's already happening to some extent through more co-payments used as you know and that should start to push down the costs the second thing is i think the extent that we have malpractice in this country is causing a lot of tests to be done that don't need to be done cya policies by hospitals so forth</p>
      <p>but then you get into some very controversial issues like the end of life if you have a terminally ill patient who has a zero percent chance of living more than two months right okay and it's going to cost a million dollars to keep them alive for two months how much should that family pay versus society i give you a horrible story when i talked to university of north carolina a crying mother came up to me because her 93 year old mother had just been put into a hospice and she was getting thousands of dollars which she didn't want for the mother and the hospice but her seven-year-old daughter couldn't get the money for an operation she needed and the woman was literally crying the juxtaposition of the ninety-year-old mother who had probably two or three months to live getting thousands of thousands of dollars but there was no funding there for the seven-year-old and this is why i say stan druckenmiller can't make this decision but it's a conversation that we have to have and we're not having it we're just saying</p>
      <p>okay as long as we can keep them alive let's keep coming in order to understand where you are uh and this is why some of this is surprising uh you we obviously have capital gains tax and we have ordinary income you basically want to see the capital gains tax rise to the rate of the ordinary income i think there's a different way to grow the economy and i also want to know what your conservative friends think of this okay so first of all let's go back to the healthy conservatives let's go back to larry summers i think taking the capital gains rate and and the dividend rates to ordinary income while you simultaneously lower corporate tax rates to zero would make the economy grow dramatically and revenues to the government would actually and then put you where larry is would actually increase the goal but he likes to do it through inve spending i like to do it through tax reform in that regard but so you take you ordinary in capital gains would go to the level of ordinary income you reduce the corporate income tax to zero yes you</p>
      <p>would assume that there wouldn't be double taxation as some people like to argue you would pay tax on corporate profits because you'd be a shareholder right yes corporations have presented as like living things to people they're not okay corporations are owned by shareholders right if you tax the shareholder you're taxing the ultimate benefit ordinary income rates yes and they're clipping coupons they're not hiring people they're not engaging capital spending and the corporations are doing that yeah and you take their rate to zero and by the way all this money they talk about overseas yeah if the corporations take that money and they buy back stock and they issue dividends that money comes back at a 40 rate they're not even bringing it back at a 35 percent rate do you think this has a chance in hell of being politically viable first question second question is the reason you're sitting at this table going all these campuses is you want to create some kind of political action that might result in it having a chance</p>
      <p>in hell the second question i want to shine a light on on this issue and i am desperately hoping the young people will start a movement do i want to start the movement i don't think i'm capable do i think i can articulate the facts and i have have i seen them respond that somebody out there could start a movement yes in my opinion they were instrumental in getting gay marriage passed they're moving the needle on the environment this thing's very similar in the environment on both of those issues you were on their side yes on the gay rights and on the environment still am okay well i mean i'm i'm trying to lay out a sec set of facts and hoping that when they look at those facts they will start to put political pressure and consider this issue as important as they do the environment and the gay rights and do you think you'll find more receptivity in the republican party of the democratic party</p>
      <p>in the youth yes i have i know what i'll see which is enthusiasm on both sides i have when jeff cannon and i have gone not only have we spoken for an hour they ask questions for a half an hour and there are 40 hands left when we lead and it doesn't matter whether we're at berkeley at brown or usc or north carolina or right or left they're all there now just explain who jeff kennedy is first of all you went both into about in college uh secondly uh he runs jeff canada runs the harlem children's own i i have been chairman of the harlem children's own since its founding and that and they do what good question um there's a hundred square blocks up in harlem they take children basically from birth all the way to through college through a bunch of what i would call social antibiotics at them education baby college pre-k try and get them through college so we can break the cycle of energy intergenerational poverty up there and</p>
      <p>as you know charlie i'm sorry didn't you intergenerational poverty and as you know there's a bunch of pilot programs some inspired by the president to try and copy that model around the country that's what jeff canada does he runs that and and you have been his big supporter from since the two of you i i was on the i was on his pre-board with his pre-organization which was the breedland and when he founded the harlem children's zone i i became the chairman and have been at his side throughout you don't have to do much but going understanding what you're doing in terms of washington i mean in terms of of young people and campuses and also looking to create a movement that has some other has the kind of legs that that same-sex marriage did and had the same kind of legs that's with some success in the environmental world uh when you go to washington and and carry your message what kind of response do you get there well uh whatever whoever whether it's a finance</p>
      <p>committee whether it's uh i went to washington rand paul believe it or not in 1990 in 1994 yeah and argued to raise the retirement age in 2011 because that's when i knew the demographics i had very little success i haven't even gone to washington this time because it's my view until the young people show them that they're concerned on this issue the people in washington will not give a damn about this yeah do you think that we i mean the government is dysfunctional obviously in terms of being able to do some things to address problems as it ought to be uh do you think we can overcome that and is this in a sense where people are saying look they can be dysfunctional in washington if they want to but we're going to create something whether this kind of issue for you or other people in which we're going to affect elections and we're going to affect uh the public mind i know we will</p>
      <p>overcome it but i don't know what the timeline on that is we have these phases in america where crazy things happen happen economically and politically and what what's going on in washington now will not be sustained i don't know when it ends we all pray it ends sometime soon maybe in the next five or ten years i happen i have great hope that maybe the right president could bring them together i don't know what's going to end it but it will end and the united states will be fine in this regard okay so we started this back talking about george u and then george soros and he's on the left and and you're somewhere on the right but on social issues are in the center what does george say about your ideas haven't talked to him about it why not i haven't gotten around to it both his sons came to me and they really liked it no come on you're smart in this why are you going to talk to him about it uh i probably i probably will in the next this is pretty new for me charlie i didn't even know i was going to do this yeah it'll probably happen in the next month or two i don't know how he'll think</p>
      <p>about it um i have been [Music] very pleasantly surprised by the reception i've gotten from the intellectual left on this issue when i got to sit down with them and explain my explain my case to them right the the stuff that's been written about objecting to what i'm saying i'm not saying so i don't want to speak for george but there will be a time in the next few months while i will certainly sit down with him and see what he thinks about it thank you for coming thank you back in a moment stay with us</p>

      <div class="transcript-body">
      <p>thanks Dan thanks Frank our final conversation today is between John Collison and Stanley dren Miller John is a polymath and pilot who together with his brother Patrick runs stripe I once had the occasion to ask a very experienced flight instructor what criteria he would use to select a pilot to ride with and he said the the key is being able to both keep your eye on the horizon and on the controls in front of you simultaneously thought that was a remarkably good description of John and it also that that ability to go from 40,000 feet to 5 feet without getting Whiplash is a quality that I feel like characterizes many of the best investors including the person John's gonna interview today Stanley Dr Miller John over to you I am delighted um to be joined uh today by Stan dren Miller and look you could say that certain people in the investing World need no introduction and in a lot of cases it might be an exaggeration but I think uh Stan is probably if you were to ask</p>
      <p>investors for their role models uh you know Stan would probably be one of the top three names uh that people give you and uh you know his performance over the last number of decades uh probably um makes that very very deserved Stan is also a uh macro Watcher uh and there's no more relevant time for us to be uh talking about that and in fact uh Stan maybe a good place to start is that you know last year year you gave an interview uh and you said uh you know investors are going to stay uh disregarding the looming signs of inflation uh you can't find any period in history where monetary and fiscal policy were this out of step with economic circumstances and that there was a raging Mania in all assets and so you said this uh last summer when everything was still kind of hunky dory uh in terms of the markets and so I don't know maybe you're pretty good at this uh this macro thing and so if that was your prediction um uh last summer which the sins more or less come to pass what are you predicting now thanks John um it was nice of you to</p>
      <p>site uh a period that's actually turned out the way I've said because in my career I've said many things that didn't turn out so your your selective picking was uh quite nice look um I I did say all that and I I would just say that a number of things happened since then uh some which didn't surprised me some which did um a the inflation was actually a little higher than I thought it would be although I thought it was going to be above 6% which at this time seemed quite radical um B the bubble has really burst with a Vengeance a lot more than you can see in the S&P lot of very good companies um have been derated 607 % without a whole lot of change in fundamentals so valuations have improved relative they were and then see I'd say</p>
      <p>the biggest surprise since I talked last spring was how slow the Fed was to recognize the problem I thought they were slow not recognizing it last in April 21 but they were still buying Bonds in March of 22 and they were still not even pivoting verbally until November I think that period was incredibly costly because a lot of assets uh a lot of assets were purchased during that period that I think a lot of people moving out the risk Curve will lose a lot of money on I would just say where are we now it it's hard to believe given the extent of the monetary policy the last 10 or 11 years I think globally we had 30 trillion of QE um even as late as I think a year ago</p>
      <p>there was 18 trillion of debt that was still negative yielding when the world was about to experience 8% inflation it's pretty it's pretty extraordinary so it's hard for me to believe you could have Unwound all that that created in terms of a misallocation of resources in 6 months so my best guess and um this business is about guessing there are no certainties is that we're six months into a bare Market that has some room to run uh for those tactically trading it's possible the first leg of that has ended um but I think it's highly highly probable that the bare Market has a ways to run is it going to be a soft Landing or a hard Landing well the answer is I don't know but the probabilities of being a soft Landing are pretty remote John um historically I think we've only pulled off two or three</p>
      <p>in history the one I lived through and remember so well was the 94 95 one but we've never had a soft Landing after inflation's gotten above 4 and a half% and the situation we face now is extraordinary where the FED um where are we these days I guess we're at 75 basis points I can't keep up but even the projections of 2% you're so far behind the inflation rate and there's so much wood to chop and there's been such a broad asset bubble going into it um it's very hard for me to say that the probability is favor of soft Landing indeed I think they aggressively point to a hard Landing anything's possible as I said earlier I've been wrong plenty of times in my career but betting on a soft Landing to me is a real is a real long shot so you think once inflation goes above 5% it's very hard to tame us in a way that's elegant well that's what history says it's there there's an interesting</p>
      <p>historical fact which in fact I think is going to be violated but two undefeated records are number one once inflation gets above 5% it's never come down unless uh fed funds have gotten above the CPI well since the CPI is eight that would call for a Fed funds rate of above eight frankly I don't think we'll get there because the extent of the asset bubble and the Damage that would be done think about the fact that we have virtually no bankruptcies and look at the probably the most disruptive period um since the 1890s uh I don't need to tell a founder of striped that um but if you look across the landscape there should have been many many many bankruptcies which have been buried by QE so if in fact fed funds ever got to 8% which by the way I don't think is going to happen um the</p>
      <p>destruction would be quite material the other the other statistical fact is once once inflation's got above 5% to use your word it's never been tamed without a recession so if you're predicting a soft Landing you're going against Decades of History Could Happen anything's possible but I don't think it's probable no I think those um historical examples are quite sobering was it you said that once inflation goes above 5% it has never come back down without the FED funds rate going above the CPI yes and the CI is currently eight year-over-year um I actually think think we are going to violate history and it is going to come down I don't know how far but without that happening the second one I think history is going to win that's once inflation gets about 5% it's never come down without a recession and I think a recession is in the cards I just don't know when we have about depending</p>
      <p>on who you listen to a trillion and a half to two trillion of excess savings now so it may take some time to work through that savings but given the extent of the asset bubble and the destruction in the markets given what's going on in Ukraine giving zero Co policy in China um I don't take a lot of comfort from that so I assume um and I'm pretty strongly assume we're going to have a recession sometime in 23 I just don't know whether it's going to be in the early part or the later part and again um it's a guess it's not a fact as we talk about what's going going on in the market uh uh or sorry in the economy and not the market you know one thing I find really interesting about your style is people like to trot out the phrase you know the stock market is not the economy but uh you have you know been on the record a number of times talking about how you use the stock market as a signal for what's going on in the market uh in the economy and so you know you have this distributed team if you look at all the you know stock</p>
      <p>analysts out there at covering all these different stocks and all these different uh sectors they're kind of like the you know engineer in the cockpit of the train and you know when the uh you know dial starts flashing and you know it's a sign that you can investigate more so I'd love you to talk about this approach where you are using movements in stock prices to decide or to to know that um something's going on there maybe I should go investigate yeah uh one of the ironies of my style maybe it's because I was a Dropout um of a PhD program in economics at University of Michigan is that I don't use what tradition economists use to predict the economy which is things like um employment and a bunch of macro top- down statistics in fact I started my career as a bank and a chemical analyst and over time I learned that the inside of the stock market had a very very preent message about future economic activity and for whatever</p>
      <p>reason stocks tend to lead the fundamental by somewhere between 6 and 12 months and you can even go beyond that and look at industries that lead the economy and industries that lag the economy the obvious one that everyone knows about is housing has traditionally been looked at as a leading IND industry retail has a slight lead capital goods lag and what we've done historically is actually even though you refer to me as a macro investor and many people have is we do the macro by a comp compilation of listening to companies and doing a Bottoms Up analysis of companies that lead the economy and comp and I'm sorry industries that lead the economy and industries that lag the economy and if the leading Industries are turning up or turning down that's a signal and that's worked beautifully historically the other signal which I have found quite pre from markets is the bond market um</p>
      <p>unfortunately the last 10 or 11 years the bond market has not signaled anything because the central banks took it upon themselves to manipulate bond prices which to me is the 10year treasury has sort of been the most important price in the world and they took that price out of the equation as a Sigler I remember last summer when certain forecasters had a different forecast than my my own kept talking about well the bond market is saying this the bond market is saying that when the tenear dropped all the way from 170 to 115 which by the way I did not anticipate but the bond market wasn't saying anything what was going on is central banks were buying trillions of dollars and manipulating the price of bonds so there was no signal I don't think you get that tainting if you look inside the stock market you could get it in the stock market as whole but if you do this approach where you look at Industries and you which lead which lag</p>
      <p>and you put the puzzle together it's been impression over time and it's certainly allowed us to consistently the last 20 or 30 years outperform the FED in terms of economic forecasts I find that really interesting uh you know equities acting as kind of this synthesized predictors for certain industries and so say If you think about understanding what's going on in housing again the economy now what kind of concretely what will you be looking at is it publicly traded REITs is it uh you know the stocks of construction companies what does that process look like for you well there there's you don't need to get real fancy here you can just do the home builders themselves and uh with supposed good fundamentals they've all declined 50% from the high another industry that's been incredibly pressing has been Trucking um and they're down 40% from the high despite the fact that they're all reporting record earnings um an industry</p>
      <p>that is not that much of a leader but it's more of a leader than a leard is the retail industry and there's been a lot in the news lately whether it's Walmart or other companies um retail that one's a little tainy you just can't take these things blindly John that one's a little tainted now because in Co retail went to 100% of the it from about 85% because we weren't going outside and traveling going to football games but even taking that into account um retail appears to be much weaker than it should be given what the so-called GDP numbers are printing so right now there's a there's a signal albe it early that um there may be trouble ahead yeah so you look at Trucking stocks being um uh you know down 50% and you say um okay this probably doesn't you know does not bode well for Trucking volumes it kind of has to be the case yeah and if it was just trucks fine but it's not just trucks it's housing it's retail it's all over the place by the</p>
      <p>way you can't get too carried away and say that means we're going to have a recession tomorrow morning a lot of these things have longer lead times like six months to a year yes one thing you're also getting at here kind of when you referenced that you used to be able to look at the bond market and kind of now you can can't is it seems um very true that the investors who perform really well over uh multiple decades have to shift stylistically over time and become new kinds of investors I kind of love the stories of you know the the value investors back in the day where if you look at what Ben Graham was actually doing you're hunting for companies where the uh you know Book value is greater than the market cap of the company the famous you know case of Northern pipeline where they're trading at $65 a share and they just had $95 a share of stuff and railroad bonds whatever on their balance sheet and he bought a bunch of their stock and then just yelled at them and complained until they finally dividend it out $95 a share of their assets but that doesn't work anymore obviously you know markets have gotten a lot more efficient and you can't just buy companies that own more assets than their market cap so value</p>
      <p>investing has to change and similar you're describing here especially you know the relationships with bonds the relationships with currencies have to change and so I'm curious can you talk a bit more about how you stylistically have had to change the the tool in your tool cast that's really an excellent question and um it's very it's it's right on point because when I got in the business um you could almost guarantee if a company reported lousy earnings open down that day and closed up big that stock market was going to be higher six months from then and vice versa you could almost always guarantee if the econ e looked great and Bonds were rallying that meant the economy was not going to look so great we used to call it price action versus news and it used to be an incredible indicator of security prices partly because of the efficiency partly because I think the growth of</p>
      <p>hedge funds we all learned these rules um and partly because of Central Bank manipulation price versus news is a very weakened tool versus 20 years years ago much to my chagrin because I always found it a great warning signal and now a lot of times it may be warning of nothing or warning of something that doesn't exist so that's been um one thing I've had to adopt to I mean frankly when I started in the business I'm showing my age here which was the mid 70s um I started in equities and I also learned particularly in bare markets that I had to morph into bonds into Commodities into foreign currencies things like that I mean one of the most challenging things for me right now is maybe it's says something about My Dysfunctional personality but</p>
      <p>I've always made even higher returns in bare markets and bull markets but the way I did it was just pretty much ignore equities take them off the table buy bonds by treasuries and go home well I've never present been presented the cocktail where you have 8% inflation you think the economy might weaken and bond yields 3% it's an analog with no precedent in history so for the golfers out there going into the situation we're describing I feel like I'm about to play around a golf without a driver and without a 60 degree wedge because bonds which have been my go-to asset in terms of of a recessionary bare Market atmosphere they may work but there's a good reason to believe things may be different this time because we've never had central banks with situation in Europe for example we have negative rates with 8% inflation or even here we've never had anything like this so</p>
      <p>you always you can't get into black and white that it's an art form investing in from cycle to cycle you have to constantly innovate and not just be a slave to past models so how are you positioning the fund given that you know maybe you don't feel so good about going long equities but your normal Bond toolkit is not working uh quite well is uh you know is the golf thing top of mind because uh you know it's actually hard to you know to do too much uh or uh how are you positioning things well currently I'm very challenged um we were lucky enough to have made some money uh up until now the last six or eight months primarily by having a a let me call it a matrix of short fixed income short stocks and not doing a whole lot in currencies and owning um some of the key Commodities particularly oil and mistakenly U gold but copper</p>
      <p>um things are a lot harder now because we're now getting definitive signals that the economy may be weakening particularly at the front end and while I'm not comfortable owning bonds I'm much less comfortable being short fixed income to the to the degree I was three to six months ago when it looked like a much better risk reward and even stocks um so many companies have been derated by 60 or 70% and I've lived through enough bar markets that if you get aggressive uh in a bare Market on the short side you can get your head ripped off in rallies So currently I'm I'm coming in every day and I'm looking at my screen but I'm pretty much taking a break um waiting for a fat pitch I'm not shooting at any pins to use a golfing analogy my anticipation is I will be</p>
      <p>going back to the short Equity position at some some point if the market affords me if not hopefully I'll just Sid step a decline that's not the worst thing in the world but the fixed income Market has become much more complicated uh and I'm lucky enough since I play in a lot of asset classes to have the luxury of not playing in one and I don't think I'm going to be playing much in that one going forward the currency Market is incredibly interesting to me I haven't been doing much there and I'm not currently position aggressively there but I will be surprised if sometime in the next six months I'm not sure the dollar 14 trillion has come in here because we were the first to tighten there's a story about American exceptionalism I'm not sure we're so exceptional anymore and if we are I'm not sure I'm excited about what we're exceptional in um so foreign exchange</p>
      <p>looks interesting we still own um energy and other Commodities um Ukraine sort of gave that trade an extended life although I must say the energy because of the transition to ESG we look to be short energy for five or 10 years so that could last a while it's so interesting to hear you talk about this stuff because you so fluidly move between all these different asset classes and um one thing that makes me think of is um crypto obviously you've done kind of a little bit in crypto before I remember you saying that it's just hard to guess the size of position that is interesting to you in crypto one thing I was wondering are you seeing crypto start to affect other asset classes and other currencies um I don't know whether I'm seeing it but I expect it to you can't take you can't build over two trillion in wealth in purchasing power and then</p>
      <p>take a trillion of it out and not matter John I also have high frequency um signals and they're certainly seems to be a strong correlation between crypto and the NASDAQ I don't think it takes a genius to figure out why so I'm looking at as an indicator that way crypto um you know everything that that Charlie Munger says about it I'm sympathetic to everything that says Bill Miller says about it I'm sympathetic too so I think that's a movie that has yet to be played out and one that I don't want to bet on conviction but I will be very surprised if blockchain isn't a real force in our economy say five years from now to 10 years from now and not a major disruptor with with companies that will um have been founded between now and then that'll do very well but that will also challenge things like our our</p>
      <p>financial companies and do do a lot of disruption so I find crypto interesting my 69th birthday is in a couple weeks I'm probably too old um to compete intellectually with the young people in this space but I'm certainly monitoring it and I was going to ask that do you think younger Stan would be kind of diving into crypto more energ energetically I think a younger Stan would be diving into everything more energetically than I'm talking to um it's age is a funny thing I don't um I feel my predictive power and forecasting power is as good as it's ever been the last three to five years but I'm certainly not making 30% net returns per year like when I had clients so I think it's two things yes um I think younger people understand new asset classes better but B I'm just not playing anything as aggressively as I</p>
      <p>used to I want to get back to that cuz that's um that's interesting but uh one other crypto related question as I think about um Bitcoin the closest analog is clearly gold and you people talk about digital Gold by which I mean if you want to remove yourself from cash if you want to be independent from inflation your government in whichever country uh uh you're in traditionally gold would be the assets that you would kind of pull back into nowadays that can be Bitcoin and so You' expect their cyclicality to be similar and yes Bitcoin is highly cyclical gold is counter cyclical historically why is that I'm not sure why other than NASDAQ type risk play takers are the ones that send to play in Bitcoin and kagin that are gold bugs and want the world to fall apart playing gold but there's no question and this I've watched and it's gone on long enough now that I believe it that if you believe we're going to</p>
      <p>have irresponsible monetary policy and inflation going forward if it's in a bull phase you want to own Bitcoin but if it's in a bare phase for other assets you want to own gold and I think I just articulated the reason but sometimes John I don't care um this has gone long on enough that I'm starting to believe what I'm observing and for sure if I think we're going to have an inflationary bull market um I'd want to own Bitcoin more than gold and if I thought we're going to have a bare Market you know stagflation type thing I'd want to own gold doesn't mean I'm going to believe that in a year but that's my assumption going forward from this point and is that because of some fundamentals of the underlying assets or just based on what you've observed in their behaviors to date it's 85% what I've observed but I would also say it's</p>
      <p>the type of investor um overthe counter um Fang type investors if they believe in inflation and they tend to be younger they want to play Bitcoin uh old kudin that that secretly want the world to fall apart they don't own Bitcoin they own gold so but that's kind of cheating because that's kind of a reason I've made up for what I've observed I think you got to you got to know your own biases um yes go going back to how you work and you know kind of the young man's game and things like that um I talked to someone who worked for you who said maybe an underrated aspect of your performance historically is you just work way harder than everyone else and there's few people who have been in the market since the 70s working with your work ethic uh and you know across such a broad range of assets H how how relevant do you think that is or how much truth do you ascribe to that I think it's very relevant um I was</p>
      <p>pretty lazy in college and I never considered myself a particular hard worker but I'm so passionate about our business that it's almost like a compulsive Gambler that has a a way to channel his compos and the fact that every event in the world affects some security price somewhere and the fact that I'm so intellectually stimulated trying to imagine the world 12 to 18 months from now versus the way it looks in the present and security prices how they would reflect that I just find it so stimulating it makes everybody think I'm a hard worker because I'm attracted to the game so in this game I am a hard worker but I actually think there's a life lesson there I've seen young people who when they find their passion who had kind of looked like they were lazy or lost their way or weren't very driven become very driven I just happen to be passionate about this</p>
      <p>particular discipline so I don't know whether I have a hard work ethic but it that that's the end result of my passion are are you then uh excited about the growth of mobile investing and you know approachable retail investing for kind of a younger crowd because it might pull more people into this or do you think it might get people in for the wrong reasons and it's a bit more of a you know blinking slot machine game the latter I mean given given what's going on the last 11 years with Central Bank policy and the breadth of the bubble I do fear for um you know one of the saying I'm sure you've heard it but I probably heard it the first week I was in the business 50 years ago it still applied bull market Geniuses um I think there's a lot of bull market Geniuses around and it's not that they love the game they love winning but they were surfing with a hurricane behind their back that was giving them these nice waves they they may become very discouraged so I don't</p>
      <p>Embrace I've heard a lot of people invas the fact that all these people are investing now in all these and how great it is I don't think it's so great if the story doesn't end well yeah and and and certainly we may see an interesting scenario play out over the next year or two um going back to your style the other thing I found very interesting uh in how you work is this uh you know your philosophy of put all your eggs in one basket and then watch this basket very carefully and you've described uh how you just develop conviction three to four times a year and act based on that and I'm curious if you could talk a little bit more about that like the the spidey sense going off and you know you're clearly in a low conviction time right now but I think that's just very stylistically interesting where you even know how to size up and down your trades yeah it's it's completely contrary to what they teach in business school which is if you're highly Diversified you have less risk than if you're highly concentrated um I don't believe that at</p>
      <p>all as an investor when I think most people get in the most trouble is when they have stale long wrs or stale shorts when you've got 15 20% of your asset base or someone times in macro positions I'll have two or three 100% um believe me they're not getting stale and you have to have ruthless discipline and you're coming in every day just to quote Andy Grove you could not be more paranoid and you're constantly reevaluating and I think it leads to an open mind so yeah I would also say people asked me what I learned from George Soros um I thought when I went there I was going to learn what made the Yen and the deuts mar go up and down and that kind of thing no what I learned was um sizing is probably 70 to 80% of the equation it's not of whether you're right or wrong it's how much you make when you're right and how much you lose when you're wrong I've also</p>
      <p>found as an investor I believe in streaks you see it in baseball you see it in everything else I see it investing sometimes you're seeing the ball sometimes you're not one of my number one jobs is to know whether I'm hot or cold and when I'm hot I'm supposed to turn the dial way up not not say okay I'm up 40% this year let's go this will look good at the end of the year go take a break no you got to make hay while you're hot and then when you're cold the last thing you should do is try and make big bets to get back to even you should you should tone yourself down so believe it or not that's that's part of the all your eggs in one basket not only do I have to see the see the investment that really excites me I also have to see myself sort of being in a good in a good trading trading Rhythm I think this is so interesting this notion of first off having hot and cold streaks because I think you know some people take issue to that you know</p>
      <p>people debate whether Hot Hands exist in basketball and all this sort of stuff but kind of believing in that but also being kind of self-aware to know that I am cold I'm going to do trades but just small ones to you know keep myself from doing anything stupid and then as you say kind of when you're hot uh uh really being able to kind of size with conviction based on that do you know when other people are hot by the way so people at the firm now at Duane do you know when to egg them on to size up their positions because you can tell they have it together I size up their views and the answer is yes so the Dark Art of technical analysis um there are technicians out there they're all rational they all look a lot of history no one runs more hot and cold and technicians one of your main jobs if you follow technicians is to know when they're hot and know when they're cold some of them that get so cold you can actually fade them and go the other way because they've got themselves all twisted up it's more fun to follow one who's hot and make money with them but</p>
      <p>but yeah absolutely I see guys within my own firm analysts who recommend things and they go on streaks too where they get an area and they they're really hot and my job as a trigger puller is to size them up the other thing I find so interesting about this Dynamic uh in terms of working with your team is the uh invest then investigate uh idea and I remember talking to someone else uh who works at Duane who uh you know described the terrifying feeling of having joined and your telling you about an idea uh you know before lunch and then they go out to lunch and they you know come back and they find that you've put on a massive position based on this just idea that they thought they were telling you and you're actually trading on and so can you talk a bit more about kind of why that matters you know why it makes sense from an EV perspective and kind of any stocks where it worked particularly well well you mentioned earlier that the business has got a lot more competitive than it was 20 or 30 years ago there is so much information out there and so many smart people in our industry have come in since 2000 when the financial</p>
      <p>renumeration went crazy that you just don't have the time you had when I got in the business when you hear a good idea if you wait two or three weeks a lot of times now believe it or not 60 or 70% of the move will taken place maybe not the long-term move but entry price is important and it's important psychologically as you add over time so yes look if some if some analyst comes in with a great idea or an idea I don't just buy it and then go tell them to do the analysis but if they have an idea that appeals to me intuitively and I really like it and it might fit in with the macro M Matrix we described earlier it might tick a bunch of boxes I mean let's just suppose somebody came in today with a copper company not because they were bullish on copper this particular company um had a new mine coming on and</p>
      <p>for whatever reason they love the management it would matter a lot if before they ever came in I was already bullish on copper going three to five years out so yes I might put on a very large position and then over the next two or three weeks tell them to really do their homework and really grind down and if the story panned out add to it if it didn't pan out just get rid of it I've just found John particularly the last 10 or 20 years you just don't have time anymore to do Deep dive analysis the world you do but if you have the intuition you buy it and then you do the analysis and then get rid of it if it doesn't pan out as opposed to wait and do the analysis and it's part of the idea here that if you're wrong you know the position is probably Net Zero when you exit if you're right then you got in a favorable time so there's an asymmetry there yeah it when when you enter it there's no story out there so hopefully</p>
      <p>in 10 days if you're wrong there's still no story there's not going to be some bare story because the guy's giving you a Bull story um but if there is a bull story it's quite likely that somebody else is going to discover it over the next two or three weeks these analysts go out to dinner with each other like four nights a week and tout their ideas and a lot of times they don't wait for the portfolio manager because they're trying to make themselves look good with the other guys at dinner too I used to do that when I have more energy um and then are there any cases where this memorably worked quite well oh sure um i' I'd say there are a number of them um I mean there's so many of them I I don't really need to point them out but uh yeah it it it works it it's a much better method or I still wouldn't be using it I've had 40 Years of test cases to do it to do it with it yeah um the other thing on the hot and cold thing that I think is so interesting is um so everyone knows the</p>
      <p>famous story of uh you know you and uh 2000 where uh you know you were getting frustrated watching uh you know others at your firm earning like eight% a day during kind of the go- go uh uh last days of the tech bubble uh and uh you know you thought all the these tech stocks were crazy you had been short the tech market and um uh and so you know you against your better judgment you kind of maybe knew deep down it was a bad idea you uh put on uh you know a long trade or a few long trades uh uh you know very briefly before the uh the market crashed and then you kind of knew you shouldn't do it and then you did it and then you did it and it kind of worked out poorly and you know famously you said um that you know what did I learn from that I learned absolutely nothing you know I knew it was a bad idea at the time I think that's the version of the story that everyone knows I think the longer version of the story of both being kind of significantly up and being kind of right in the shorts is uh super interesting and then the kind of cold period followed by the hot period that</p>
      <p>came after that in 2000 so I was wondering could you tell kind of the longer version of that because I think that's really interesting and gets to this the importance of not only being rice but knowing that you're rise when it comes to being a Trader yeah the the long version is very simple it actually started quite a while before I um I I didn't do it in the beginning but sometime I believe in like March of 99 I got the brilliant idea to short like 10 internet stocks which were up like seven or Eightfold at Soros and I think I put 200 million into the quantum fund short and within about four weeks the 200 million investment was a $600 million loss I didn't just misstate that I lost eight times I'm sorry four times um well three times my investment so because the 200 million went to 800 million then I covered it so I was very bruised I was down mid teens I'd never</p>
      <p>been down double digits before and I was I was exhausted and then I kind of backed off and for a few months I realized Greenspan was doing this h huge easing program because of the Asian financial crisis but there was no crisis in the United States but we were pumping all this money in and I could see the the tech Revolution and I said oh my god I've got to go along so one of the things I did was hired two two people in their 20s who were sort of Gunslingers because I knew gets back to Bitcoin now I knew the younger people knew the new companies like veritos and verisign and that kind of stuff I didn't know how to spell them so we then I'm down like 16% or something we pivot into this stuff in the summer and by the end of the year we're up 42% net uh we have this massive year I go into George in January and I said this is crazy we're in a bubble I'm</p>
      <p>selling all the technology stocks so I sell them this is January and then the two Gunslingers are still there they have little small accounts so I can size them up when they're hot or cold per earlier conversation and as you just said they're making like 8% a day and it's driving me out of my mind because I'm out of the market so we're now getting into March and there's the little devil here going March of 2000 the little devil here is going do it do it and the little devil here is saying don't do it don't do it and I think I missed the top by an hour and you said bought a few things I didn't buy a few things I put like I think six billion and which turned into a massive loss two or three billion um I knew like an five days after I did it but the whole exit it was messy so now I'm down like 18% again and</p>
      <p>I had just been down 18% the year before and I'm literally like an emotional mess and to your point I know I'm an emotional mess so I go into Soros and I say I'm quitting um I need a break I'm exhausted I write a letter to the cane investors I had I had you know two firms going and I said I'm I'm going on sabatical I might come back I might not right now I'm a mess if you want your money here's the number just call we'll send you all your money back I did cheat a little I said if you take your money out I might not let you back in but you're free to take it all out okay so I go to Africa with my kids I don't allow myself to see a TV or to read a financial newspaper so I don't know where anything is so it's a true break which is something I'd advise young traders to do if you take a break take a break don't sit there and like</p>
      <p>trade your own account and mess around so I come back on Labor Day because my kids are going back to school and I'm sure my wife doesn't want around the house so I open up a newspaper and I can't believe it the NASDAQ has recovered like 70 or 80% of their losses the S&P is almost back to the high but oil is up interest rates are up and the dollar is up by the way that might sound a little familiar and this has always been terrible for corporate earnings looking forward so I mentioned this to my good friend Ed Heyman I go what's going on and uh I said oil is up interest rates are up and the dollar is up why why is the market up in the meantime I'm calling all my ex-clients who are small businessmen I didn't have big fancy clients and they're all telling their business is terrible okay so Ed sends back a regression thing two days later showing that if you have oil interest rates he he plugged in the percentages and the dollar up this amount earnings</p>
      <p>the next year forward based on history go down 35% % and the average earnings estimate of the Wall Street guys is up 18 so I then get the idea and I'm down and one of my trading rules is you don't trade a lot when you're down but I've had a break my mind is fresh I just love this idea so I put 350% tenure equivalent of the fund into um treasuries betting that Greenspan as a tightening director will reverse and we'll go into a recession and to make a long story short I make 40% in the fourth quarter even though I had given up on the year and decided I was finally going to have a down year that's the end of the story but importantly you think you wouldn't have had the conviction to actually do those trades at least in the proper size you not Tak I will go to my grave believing if I had sat in my office whole year grinded away looked at</p>
      <p>the screen I would not have had my brain was too messed up in May and it would not have gotten unsed up watching that price action I will go to my grave believing it was by stepping aside and clearing my head that enabled me not only to see the trade but to have the gpin to put it on in size because I needed that four months to rebuild my confidence you you kind of talked about being low conviction now you know you're not actually short equities though maybe you'd like to be or you think you at might be in future what do you think getting to higher conviction in the current envi environment might look like oh I think if if the market were to Rally 15 to 20% from here over the intermediate term I'm going to take a shot because six months bare markets preceded by asset bubbles don't exist historically and I think we still have a lot of wood to chop um if I you're</p>
      <p>rating for the dead what's that you're rating for the dead cat pounds you're rating for the uh the fs it might not be so dead that's why I'm not still like invested the way I was two or three weeks ago I was quite short um interest rates I want to hear where the FED is I want to follow the company data we're following to to see how this thing is unfolding and then of course there's this whole inflation debate and and I could see like the FED says food and energy don't count because they're core we'll tell that to a labor union who what do you think they're going to go in there and they're going to negotiate say okay guys don't worry we only need 3% because the core PC is only up 4% we're not worried about the fact that our own cost of living is up 16% so I want to see if that's embedded I want to see all this by the way one of the reasons in addition to low conviction ition is back to what we're talking</p>
      <p>about I'm taking a mental break I'm at work but I want to be fresh and this has been a lot of activity the last four or five months and it may be in a week it may be in three week maybe three months I'm in no hurry here I'll need to you're you're tapering before the marathon you're giving yourself a break before you expect to get pretty busy or I'm in the marathon and I'm not running full out on the on on mil 16 yes yes um if you were what do you think 20-year-old Stan dram Miller today would be getting into or doing differently as you just look at or maybe you know this comes up in as you give advice to you know I know you talk to kind of college students a bunch and things like that but again the investing game has changed a lot and so uh you know maybe it got made more sense to get into bonds back when you could do interesting things there back when the market weren't so uh so wacky as they are today you have a particular skill set you know you're you're not going to</p>
      <p>learn you know entirely new domains maybe kind of at this stage and so if you have a very sharp very hardworking investor who is looking at what should they become an expert in to be really successful where would you be steering them that you know is maybe different to where you play well the first thing I'd tell them is if you're not really passionate if you don't love this stuff go do something else and I've hired guys with IQs 50 or 60 points higher than me who stink in my business because and by the way they could be off inventing or or starting new companies that could do very well but um I actually think the next four to five years are going to be tailored to the skill set that worked for me in in the 80s and 90s which was all sorts of macro chaos and I would encourage them to</p>
      <p>learn all the asset categories and how how they integrate not easy if I was a tech investor um I would certainly be learning you know we had the internet wave we had the cloud wave Cloud doesn't look like it's over yet but I would certainly be look be looking into blockchain very deeply and the possible disruption it might take but I think fundamentals are fundamentals look when companies are losing money capaity is always going to shrink and their margins are going to look better in three years when companies are over earning their margins are going to come down in three years I think all that stuff will be out there I think the great thing about my original Mentor Spiros dris in Pittsburgh was he made me focus on what moves the stock price like you can't just say Stan okay this is a great company and the earnings are great he said tell me how people are going to think differently in 18 or 24 months</p>
      <p>about the situation than they're thinking now that would be my number one advice to the young people do not do not invest in the present the present is not what moves stock prices change moves them and I want you to try and envision a different world in a year and a half from now and where these security prices would trade versus now given the world you envision that would be my number one advice to a young person getting in the business didn't that happened to a surprising extent during covid that people were always investing in the you know the present where Airlines will never make money again oh actually airlines are fine you know a bunch of Internet beneficiaries are the greatest stocks in the world oh actually maybe they're just kind of normal companies but why it kind of it seems like the stock market was pretty inefficient over Co why why were been investing in the pr rather than two years out I think it's what you said earlier I think a lot of new investors particularly retail came in and they were rewarded immediately in the early</p>
      <p>parts of Co supposedly there's like 400 billion in retail in the market now that wasn't there two years ago so they were rewarded immediately by buying Amazon and buying the stuff you know huge obvious immediate pelaton Co beneficiaries but they'd never played the game I didn't have I don't have the nerves I used had but this was the was the best short selling period I've ever seen the last year or two because never before were there such obvious over earners like particularly brick and mortar retail you know you see companies that don't grow for 15 years and all of a sudden um and I'm not talking about Amazon I'm talking about old brick and mortar companies all of a sudden the stocks have quadrupled it didn't take a rocket scientist to figure out two or three years from now oh people will start traveling again uh you know uh</p>
      <p>companies will will overspend you know all the stuff that typically happens so I think Co was a unique opportunity I think the fact that all this new money came into the market made it even more unique and and exaggerated in terms of opportunity is that a common way you make money in equities is kind of spotting mean reversion or uh noticing where people are maybe valuing a company based on last year's results as opposed to the steady state performance of the business I have a bias toward growth stocks um luckily not so big of a bias that I didn't uh ignore it um the last year or two but I think if you can Enis Vis A company that 3 to 5 years from now is going to be in a much much better situation than it is today um long term that's my bias where to go but yes um on a cyclical basis I've always done what</p>
      <p>you said maybe because one of my first groups was chemicals and they were really easy John when they were losing money you were supposed to buy them because everybody shut capacity down the next two or three years but people are still going to need chemical and when they made a m made a bunch of money they used this was the markets weren't efficient they used to announce all these capacity expansions so you knew what was going to happen well i' taken those lessons you know forward 30 or 40 years and they still work so yeah I do a lot of counter cycal stuff but really I'd say the biggest money I've made in equities have been in Gross stocks over time um when you talk about your buyas for growth stocks is Big Tech getting kind of too cheap uh for you to uh to to not be in it as you look at a lot of um the the gaffas I mean they they earn very large amounts of money and so is that uh is that something that's starting to become attractive to you not yet I'm just too</p>
      <p>um I'm too bearish on the world um to go there yet although I will say that they've gotten too cheap for for me for them to be my shorts anymore they were widely regarded as uh over earning over earners in covid and maybe they were early on but it was so widely broadcast the true over earners were things to me like retail Trucking or today ocean ocean shipping companies just have these massive margins I can Envision a world where World Trade is not booming in two years by the way um so I think it wasn't obvious it was obvious who the over earners were the that first six months all you had to do is go down the chain and pick them off the last year and a half it's gotten much harder because 80% of that set is already down to a place where I'd rather not play and I don't have my sandwich I don't have bonds um to go to and just ignore that</p>
      <p>world yeah and uh how about energy you mentioned the world being short energy how do you actually um put that into uh how how do you actually trade that we're there I mean it's been widely publicized people looking at 13fs by the way which I would caution against because that's old data and in this case with us it's true I'm very nervous because it's not the unique thesis it was six months ago in terms of looking out 18 months where these companies might be but I think the reasons we're still there is we just see this thing as being more sustainable because of ESG and all the reasons we all know about um that it can last a while and that doesn't seem to have been priced in the stocks but it's not a classic Duane play because it's now become widely recognized but I don't just sell something because people talk about pain</p>
      <p>trade I don't care about pain trade this or that um we we think these companies are still cheap relative to what we see a year or two out the big problem would obviously be if you have a horrendous worldwide recession but we'll look for um we're looking for demand destruction in energy but so far we don't see it makes sense makes sense um maybe to uh to close out you know if we go back to um you know one other prediction I don't think I'm Cherry prediction cherry picking um good predictions I think uh I think you've just had a lot of them but obviously you know you were warning at this very conference in at 2005 17 years ago you were warning about you know the prospect of a you know a great financial crisis and you were uh you were very bearish at that conference and so kind of like uh you know doctors or nurses use the Pain Scale one to 10 in terms of what what you're feeling if we say one is everything's great feeling super excited about the economy and the market H just couldn't be better and 10 is Max</p>
      <p>on the uh bearishness scale in uh in this context where you know maybe you were at a nine back then when you were when you warning about this back in 2005 how would you describe where you are today I'm glad you asked this because this is my 45th consecutive year as a chief investment officer and in 45 years I've never seen a constellation while I was a practitioner or frankly studied one where there's no historical analog so right now I probably have more humility in terms of My Views going forward than I've had maybe ever but I would say if I have an objection out there in 2009 I made a statement inside the firm was well we won't have another financial crisis for 30 or 40 years because once you have one of these</p>
      <p>everyone learns from it and we get disciplined and it takes them that long to screw up again the last one we had was obviously 29 I'm not so sure I buy into all this stuff about bank balance sheets and this and that what the central banks globally have done the last 10 or 11 years I'm not predicting this John but it leaves me open-minded to something really really bad um so that's the guy on this shoulder we were talking about earlier um the other shoulder is saying this is an analysis harder than you've ever faced in 45 years so please be open-minded because this is not a story we've seen before so the ending is not as predictable as it has been in other parts of your career Two 2005 was a no-brainer I thought by the way I didn't make much money in ' 06 why was it such a no-brainer because I looked at a housing chart and for 50 years it went up like</p>
      <p>this and then in five years it went like that and I knew that people had taken 800 million home equity loans out and spent it and I knew that all this stuff was going to come back on the bank balance sheets because they had secure artize this stuff with Clos and stuff but they had done it in a way that it could come back and I had a brilliant analyst from Leman Brothers come in sort of your story earlier probably the best example of it lay out the whole subprime thing for him and he said by the third quarter of ' 07 all hell's going to break loose and by the way by the time he left that meeting over the next two days I shorted everything to do with housing and in ' 06 I was wrong for six months it drove me crazy um but the analysis was consistent so the the deeper we dug the more confident we</p>
      <p>got so uh you know you said after uh the GFC that we won't have another financial crisis like this for 30 or 40 years now you're not predicting it but you're just saying you're not so sure what could that look like you know is this you tied it to money printing is this a uh you know dollar losing Reserve currency status issue is this a you know another banking crisis plus again I know you're not saying this will happen but as you think about the Grim scenarios what what could they look like I I'm really not predicting this but think of the 30s a post asset bubble just absolute destruction in buying power going forward and then do we have the FED pump it all up again and we get some kind of horrible sort of stagflation thing or do we actually get deflation uh I hate to be a hedger but somebody always ask is this going to end</p>
      <p>in inflation or deflation I go I don't know 70% inflation this was a year and a half ago um 30% deflation they said what do you mean deflation I said well we've never had inflation because we were too close to the zero bound that's why I was so angry at the FED about worried about 1.7 every deflation has preceded an asset has followed an asset bubble and since the FED has created the biggest asset bubble and by the way there other Central Bank rather in history and the broadest even though a lot of the air has been let out of the balloon it's so big I just have to be open-minded the consequences so we've had two really bad ones in the last 100 years the US in the 20s and Japan in ' 89 they're still suffering so it could be just no growth and sideways for 15 or 20 years like 66</p>
      <p>to 82 in terms of the markets or it could be something more pernicious like we had in Japan frankly I don't know um I'm just trying to be open-minded I am you're reminding me as as you kind of talk about some of these scenarios and you know you think we're maybe not being imaginative enough in our pessimism and and I you know think about your um various predictions I also you know I enjoy reading Paul singer's letters at Elliot and he's always you know complaining about uh nerp and zerp and uh you know the propagate uh uh policies of governments around the world but you know it feels to me that macro Watcher or macro investor is kind of synonymous with macro pessimist why is that um for some reason it's like intellectually stimulating but I would say one practical reason is in in bare markets that's when macro make all their money because that's when you have the or used to have the biggest Bond moves</p>
      <p>and the biggest currency moves this stuff really moves in chaos so a macro investor sort of helps roots for chaos and we're all competitive Fanatics so you also outperform everybody on an absolute and on a Rel basis I think that's one and I would also say that Paul and I have the same disease which is I started the business 76 the first five years were a bare Market I did well I have a bearish bias I know it one of my jobs is to manage myself and know that that bias exists but it does exist in me and your listeners should be aware of that so maybe all this pessimism I'm spewing uh isn't going to happen well no but you're interesting right because you're you're a bearish but uh or a bearish bias but you're also perfectly happy going long equities growth stocks everything like that and so you have plenty of options in a bull market yeah and I I frankly made a fortune from 82 to 87 I was a Ronald Reagan nut and I</p>
      <p>was wildly bullish and uh I was bullish you earlier you were massively up in 99 yep and frankly from 95 to 99 I did really well um yeah I look there was an there was an old time where most of your um listeners won't know this guy Robert Wilson one of the greatest short wellers sellers ever it's really cool to make money in a short because it's different but any great short seller will tell you they made 90% of their money on the long side the math is with you yeah well I I think you've given me lots of uh reasons to sleep worse tonight uh and new things to uh to worry about so uh uh that is exciting but I do think it's very thought-provoking that maybe we are not being imaginative enough about uh about the things that could go wrong and again you know tying back to your story um uh about uh you know the year 2000 when uh oil's up interest rates are up and the dollar is up it has not historically tended to uh to portend well for the economy um I I</p>
      <p>would also say that two guys Warren Buffett and Ken Lang goon that have done quite well say never bet against America so I think um the audience has to keep that in mind too yes though that has always been true over the long term yes yes with underlining the long term yes well St listen this has been an absolute pleasure uh I I found this fascinating and so just really thank you for your time and uh excited to uh uh to uh to see you at the next one thank you John and uh I think we're both happy to do anything for Iris so and their contributions have been a measur able so appreciate it thanks Sean</p>

      <div class="transcript-body">
      <p>hi I'm Ralph Powell and the CEO of real vision but it's my pleasure to personal introduce one of the most incredible conversations that I've ever seen or we've ever had a real vision and it's led by my good friend Carol Sokolov Carol is one of the most legendary people in the investment research business you can see by the quality of the guests that he brings to real vision that his contacts in the finance industry and the wider world are completely unparalleled and this time he'll is going to do something extraordinary for us in this episode he's going to interview one of the greatest investors of all time Stanly drama stan is perhaps the best 30 year track record in money management history his compounded over 30 percent returns and he's never had a down year over a hundred and twenty quarters he's only lost money in five when how is this even possible how has he managed to make money day after day year after year decade after decade that's a question that nobody's ever been able to answer that is until now</p>
      <p>you see Stanley Druckenmiller has never given an interview like this before and in this incredible conversation Stan tells Carol how he was able to build that track record how he operates in this new world of distorted price signals and the opportunities and risks that he says lie ahead it's a truly extraordinary conversation that every investor want to watch and then return to time and time again there's so much learning in this so now in the second episode by Carol sokoloff series please enjoy the full conversation with Stanley Druckenmiller [Music]</p>
      <p>stan is a great pleasure to have you here great to be here Karl I've enjoyed your work for many many years so I'm excited about the opportunity thank you well we are - we've been friends for 25 years both of us are very low profile people we avoid publicity and thank you for trusting in me to do this what I really want to drill down on is that incredible brain of yours that's created this phenomenal track record that is really the best in history 30 years performance nanchang outside money never had a down year 120 quarters only 5 or down 30% compounded over 30 years you know how did you do it and to try to understand the mindset the approach the intelligence that enabled you to do that and secondly to take that and bring it forward to today's complexity how you look at the world what challenges what opportunities how are you operating differently given the</p>
      <p>fact that algos are running the markets free money has destroyed price signals and third to discuss Stan Druckenmiller whose other passions your family your extracurricular activities and your philanthropy which which you do in a very low-key way which of course is the best way to do it so let me start off by asking you a question and your balance life people in our business tend to be very focused and very driven but I wouldn't say that not that many of them are happy and you're a happy man you've got a balanced life you're one of the great philanthropists in America you have a beautiful evolved spiritual wife or you love you've got three lovely daughters who are all successful and that is balanced life with this incredible performance and you're happy</p>
      <p>man how do you do it that's kind of you to say the balanced life is the key and in my case Fiona and I are both very private people so we don't really go out on the social scene in New York at all we might go to three events a year whereas I think most of my peers might go to three a week and that frees up a lot of time I had the benefit of a very highly intelligent creative wife who's now had four different careers she repots herself about every 10 years who after my children were born she gave up everything to raise those children and she did in a very intense creative way she just have this thing</p>
      <p>called special time where each child one day a week for two or three hours after school could go anywhere in New York can any activity with her because she thought it was important with sibling rivalry to have individual time with each so at all it all sort of starts with her and then I would really weigh in on the weekends and maybe because I married a little late with her which was when I was 35 I was successful enough at the time and had acquired enough knowledge that I was able to spend most of my time with the kids on on the weekends if it had been my 20s I think it would have been a disaster that's been a very very important part of the balance it's interesting where someone asked me Oh Fiona and I talked about the difference between men and women and their response to their children and you have to understand our children are 28</p>
      <p>27 and 25 and even today when she has full-time jobs she's running a business she says the first hour of her day is spent thinking of all the things she's gonna do it for the children that day through texts and emails she's gotten and arranged it and it's the first thing she thinks about of course the first thing I think about is euro and the end and I love my children but it's just it's a whole different mindset and I've been a huge beneficiary of that and one of my early mentors said with children if you get the first five years right you were awarded the rest your life and if you get him wrong you're tortured it's on your life that you're Fiona extended the five to about 20 years but having a happy family provides a whole lot of happiness and a whole lot of balance so I think that's that's pretty much been the key and that's freed up the extra time to do</p>
      <p>some physical activities as well as the philanthropy you mentioned we're all worried about entitlement for our kids and we're always struggling with with that how did you deal with it you know that is such a fascinating question Fiona and I had a totally different philosophy on that she felt no holds bar in giving the kids material stuff and there was no reason to hide our wealth from them I thought she was crazy and this was gonna be a disaster but it was her area and I deferred to her I've never heard her say no to those kids on anything except video games it's the only thing that was really heavily discord and she said no to and I guess</p>
      <p>through osmosis or observing the parents values or whatever somehow strangely they all ended up being high achievers we never ever talked to them about philanthropy or charity or giving back and yet they've all done stuff very actively to help the disadvantaged I'm not sure how or why it all happened but I guess it starts again with the mother that was with them so much time and taught them values but it's bizarre because I'll never forget in the third grade we had a teacher review with our oldest child she wasn't there and the teacher wanted to know what Fiona had done because the other wealthy kids were all bragging how they had country houses and this and that and she said that Sarah our oldest daughter would never ever talk about any</p>
      <p>of that and want to know how we had school during that but it was never ever brought up so we'd never hid their wealth from them so Fiona kind of broke every rule in the book that you would read about in dealing with this subject but things have worked out extremely well I'll congratulations nothing like a happy man and a happy family so moving on to the world that we're living in this has been an especially volatile year we've got a new fetch here we have possible contagion in emerging markets we have a huge new fiscal stimulus in the u.s. it's distorting things and we have a very aggressive foreign policy and trade policy on the part of the United States so taking all that and whatever else you're focused on were you really thinking about what do you where's your focus right now yeah well since free money was instituted I have really struggled I haven't had any down years</p>
      <p>since I started a family office but thank you for quoting the 30 year record and I don't even know how I did that when I look back and I look at today but I promptly made about 70% of my money during that time in currencies and bonds and that's been pretty much squished and become a very challenging area both of them as a profit Center so while I started in equities and that was my bread and butter my first three or four years in the business I've evolved in other areas and it's a little bit of Back to the Future the last eight or nine years where I've had to refocus on the equity market and I also have bare itis because I made my highest absolute return for all in bear markets I think I was average of turning bear market was well over 50% so I've had a bearish bias</p>
      <p>and I've been way too cautious the last say five or six years and this year is no exception I came into the year with a very very challenging puzzle which is rates are too low worldwide you have negative real rates and yet you have balance sheets being expanded by central banks at the time of a trillion dollars a year which I knew by the end of this year was going to go to zero because the u.s. was obviously going to go from printing money and QE to letting 50 billion a month starting actually this month run off on the balance sheet I figured Europe which is doing 30 billion euros a month would go to zero so the question to me was if you go from a trillion in central bank buying a year</p>
      <p>to zero and you get that rate of change all happening within a 12-month period does that not matter if global rates are still what I would call any appropriate for the circumstances and those circumstances you have outlined perfectly you pretty much have had robust global growth with massive fiscal stimulus in United States or the unemployment rate is below four if you came down from Mars you would probably guess the Fed Funds rate would be four or five and you have a president screaming because it's at 175 I maybe because I have a bearish bias kind of had this scenario that the first half would be fine but then by July August she'd start to discount the shrinking of the balance sheet I just didn't see how that rate of change would not be a challenge for equities that other than</p>
      <p>Pease and that's because margins are an all-time record we're at the top of the valuation round any measure you look except against interest rates and at least for two or three months I've been dead wrong so that was sort of the the overcome overwhelming macro view interestingly some of the things that tend to happen early in a monetary tightening are responding to the QE shrinkage and that's obviously as you've cited emerging markets so the the cocktail I mixed up for here was to continue in this and going on for three or four years at my firm to continue on the disruptors that would be the cloud-based companies the internet companies to be short the disrupted which would be things like retail staples that kind of stuff and with</p>
      <p>regard to China to continue to own who I thought would be the winners in the Chinese internet it's been a below-average year mainly because the Chinese Internet's which were very very good to me the last two or three years have been pretty much of a disaster this year I gave an interview at Sun Valley not this year but last year and said that I thought the Chinese Internet's were at less risk of government regulation than the US Internet and everyone in the audience held would laughter and I said no I'm serious because they're partnering with the government because they have all this information that the handover the government the internet has been the greatest friend the Communist Party could ever imagine whereas 15 years ago I would have told you the internet was going to destroy them well at least on the gaming side with $0.10 I've been dead wrong and it's</p>
      <p>extended to drag that whole group down the other thing had happened two or three months ago mysteriously my retail and staple shorts that have just been fantastic relative to my tech Long's just have had this miraculous recovery and I've also struggled mightily and this is really concerning to me it's about the most trouble I've been about my future as a money manager maybe ever is what you mentioned the cancelling of price signals but it's not just the central bank's if it was just the central bank's I could I could deal with that but I'm one of my strengths over the years was having deep respect for the markets and using the markets to predict the economy and particularly using internal groups within the market to make predictions and I think I was</p>
      <p>always open-minded enough and had enough humility that if those signals challenged from my opinion I went back to the drawing board and made sure things were changing these algos have taken all the rhythm out of the market and have become extremely confusing to me and when you take away price action verses news from someone who's used for i-section news as their major disciplinary tool for 35 years it stuff and it's become very tough I don't know where this is all going if it continues I'm not gonna return to 30% a year anytime soon not that I think I might not anyway but one can always dream when the free money ends we'll go back to a normal macro trading environment well let's talk about the hell coasts we haven't seen the algos cell we see now goes by we saw a little bit of it in February when there was</p>
      <p>some concentrated selling we saw it in China in 2015 which was really scary most of the people weren't focused on that but I was I think you were too and their program to sell if the markets down 3% machines are running can't be stopped a huge amount of trading and money is being managed that way and we've been operating in a bull market and a strong economy what happens when it's a bear market and a bad economy and will things get out of hand so knowing that and knowing that weird risk of that any moment unfolding January February just came like this how are you protecting yourself and insulating you were you watching for if that might happen it's a little bit like after 9/11 waiting for the next terrorist act in which case you would have missed where a roaring bull market for the next six years because you're sitting there because Dick Cheney</p>
      <p>told your neighbor you're supposed to move out in New York I'm just gonna trust my instincts and technical analysis to pick up this stuff but I but I will say that and I proved it to my own detriment the last three or four years the minute the risk/reward gets a little dodgy I get more cautious than I probably would have been without this in the background but I want to be clear that the major challenge for the algos for me is not some horrible market event right I can actually see myself getting caught in that but I could also see myself perhaps taking advantage of it the challenge for me is these groups that used to send me signals it doesn't mean anything anymore I gave one example this year so the pharmaceuticals which you would think are the most predictable earnings streams out there so there shouldn't be a lot of movement one way</p>
      <p>or the other from January to May they were massive underperformers in the old days I'll look at that relative strength and I'll go this this group is a disaster okay Trump's making some noises about drug pricing their background but they clearly had chart patterns and relative patterns of suggest this groups a real problem they were the worst group of any I follow from January to May and with no change in news and with no change in Trump its narrative and if anything an acceleration in the US economy which should put them more toward the back of the bus and the front of us because they don't need a strong economy they have now been about the best group from May until now and I could give you 15 other examples and that's the kind of stuff that didn't use to happen and that's the</p>
      <p>major challenge of the algos for me now what you're talking about now that that might be a challenge for society and the investing public in general and yes I could get caught like anybody else in them but yeah there's probably some degree of having one foot out the door the other eye whether otherwise might not have because I do know this is in the background you do know though I read I skim the article but there was something in the paper about how we're taking more measures to put in circuit breakers whatever they call those things to stop the phenomena you're talking about doesn't mean they'll be effective but so how are the algos operating why are they distorting the price signals well I'll just again tell you why it's so challenging for me I a lot of my style as you build a thesis hopefully that no one else is built you sort of put some positions on and then when the</p>
      <p>thesis starts to evolve and people get on and and you see the momentum start to change in your favor then you really go for it you pile into the your piling of the trade it's what my former partner George Soros was so good at and we call it if you follow baseball it's the slugging percentage that's supposed to batting average well a lot of these algos apparently are based on standard deviation models so just when you would think you're you're supposed to pollen and lift off their models must tell them because you're three standard deviations are where it's supposed to be they come in with these massive programs that go against the beginning of the trend and if you really believe in yourself it's an opportunity but if you're a guy that uses price signals and price action versus news it makes you question your scenario so they all have many many different schemes they use and different</p>
      <p>factors that go in and if there's one thing I've learned currencies probably being the most obvious every 15 or 20 years there's regime change so currencies traded on current account until Reagan came in and then they traded on interest differentials and about five years ten years ago they started trading on risk-on risk-off and a lot of these algos are built on historical models and I think a lot of their factors are inappropriate because they're missing they're in an old regime as opposed to a new regime and the world keeps changing but they are they are very disruptive if if price action versus news is a big part of your process like it is for me so how does that play out is is this going to get worse or does it blow up how do you see it</p>
      <p>I pray it blows up but I don't see that happening because money manager is so bad I assume they're gonna outperform and I need a 95% of the money managers I think you know I don't know whether you've read Kasparov book but he thinks like the ultimate chess player is not the machine it's the machine with a man and his intuition using the machine heavily I think there's always gonna be five or ten maybe not a lot more humans who the best machine in the world the alphago type thing will never beat that human as long as he's using the machine and they need to be used and they need to be understood I can't see me passing my money on their machine but I think I'd be an idiot not to know the effect</p>
      <p>these machines are having and frankly using them it's just one more input that I didn't have 20 or 30 years ago but you've got to understand when the signals are real and when they're driven by them and you got to understand the timeframes are using machines yourself I have money with a couple of machines it's very small amount of money it's just enough money so they send me signals when they think something dramatic is happening and I'm early enough on in the process that I don't know my conclusion but I assume a lot of these machines are on the same factors and if the machines start saying something is gonna happen they send me a notice and that's to use a football term that's under review I'm gonna watch this for a year or two and see if they're on to some or if they aren't and there seems to be</p>
      <p>correlations that have no make no sense yes for example the R&B and gold are trading very closely I mean it makes no sense you know and that's very dangerous and even day to day there's correlations that make no sense it's all messed up my great hope is a we get out of this ridiculous monetary regime and when we do that things start to make sense again I've always I've as you know maybe to a fault have been critic of the new monetary regime which is very academically run and I've always talked part of capitalism which you got to have a hurdle rate to investment right you can't just go on these silly inflation this and that right that if you're gonna make an investment it should have some</p>
      <p>hurdle rate and I think taking the hurdle rate away from investments and all this stuff is causing a lot of this stuff we're talking about I don't know that but that's my intuition and I'm hoping that a we go back to some sort of normal regime sometime in the next 20 years and then I'm hoping that the stuff you're talking about at least diminishes greatly but I don't know Carol I just don't know yeah like everything else I'm open-minded on it so summer of 2017 there was a hope that Kevin Warsh might run the Fed he worked for you for seven years I met him he was against qe2 as you were as I was and unfortunately that didn't happen he worked for you for seven years so he still works for me he still works and whatever what a fantastic opportunity to have him a Fed chair grounded in the real world for once so</p>
      <p>if you were running the Fed now what would you do and give the two challenges that you obviously know but for the audience if you if you don't raise rates you know asset prices continue to build and one of your major points in the past has been the way you caused a deflation is to deflate an asset bubble that went too high that's been a major concern of yours and of mine on the other hand because of the enormous rise in debt two hundred forty seven trillion ups eleven percent in the last year three times global GDP a lot of companies and countries would be bankrupt if interest rates go too high plus all the malinvestment that took place as funds were forced to lend money in ridiculous rates so how do we how do we regularize this is really a problem and you said i'm low care under the radar where to use but in every private talk i've given for the last five years</p>
      <p>I've answered this question the same way but it's a much much much more challenging situation than five years ago for the reasons you cite one of the more incredibly revealing things Trump said when he went after the central bank is we shouldn't be raising rates don't they know we have all this debt to issue I'm coming up but it's the chicken in the egg the reason that has exploded again there's no hurdle rate for investment and when you can borrow money at zero of course debt is going to explode so you're exactly right we have this massive debt problem if we don't normalize it's going to accelerate and cause a bigger problem down the road if we do normalize we're gonna have a problem and unfortunately we're gonna have a much bigger problem than we would have had if we had normalized four or</p>
      <p>five years ago so I'm gonna give you the same answer I gave it at dinner of four or five years ago is I would raise rates every meeting as long as I could and the minute you got 15 an shal disruption I would back off and the sad thing is since I made that statement oh my god we've had these just rip-roaring markets and what I was saying is just sneak one in every time you can just sneak one in yeah and they've passed up on so many golden opportunities but the problem now and you you articulated it beautifully is now the debt is so much higher particularly in emerging markets than it was five years ago you're not going to be able to raise that much more and we're already starting to see the consequences but somehow if I'm reading them correctly which is not easy they</p>
      <p>seem to have stumbled into what with chairman Powell pretty much the formula I would be doing now although I wouldn't be on this quarterly path it's way too predictable which is as I'm reading them by the way other people with just as big brains are reading in the opposite they're gonna go every opportunity they have until you have a dramatic tightening and financial conditions and because of the debt out there that's how I would play it right now you can't just say okay I'm going to three and a half or four no you just sneak one in see if they handle that well when I say they handle it I'm not talking about a five or ten percent correction I'm talking about though all all the various measures out there that we need to look at that's that's what I would do but but it's just kind of ridiculous with unemployment rate at three eight here and conditions where</p>
      <p>they aware are everywhere to have rates at this level and probably the most egregious has been the ECB and one can't even imagine the rot that must be in those banks from malinvestment ah well I remember back in 96 I think we were both in the same place that the contagion and emerging Asia and I was arguing is going to spread to all emerging countries and they come back to the United States which it did but it fueled all that money came in to the u.s. and fueled the u.s. bubble much worse than it would have been so the question is if we keep raising rates is that same scenario going to happen putting our market more at risk of higher evaluations I don't think that last blast off in the now stuff and that was because of higher rates I think it was because if you remember we cut in</p>
      <p>September of 98 then when they'd their inter meeting cut in mid-october and then with the market a new high Greenspan did one final cut at the end of October and I remember having been bearish that summer and then doing an about-face thinking we don't need to be easing there's nothing at all wrong with the American economy and this this money is probably going to flow into the US so I think the phenomena you described has already been been happening right so I think we're somewhat well on the way it's interesting you bring up that period because one of the more disturbing things that Powell said in Jackson Hole was his praising of Greenspan in the late 90s in my opinion and by the way it's all over the media what a genius he was for not hiking and letting the thing run my opinion that was the original sin when the Nasdaq</p>
      <p>went to 125 times earrings at a dot-com bust and then because of the dot-com bust we offset that with it with the housing thing so that started the whole thing so I have a very you hate to have a different opinion with the central bank consensus because you're not into the central bank they are but so no I think the phenomena you're talking about is already happening that money is flowing in here and we have a you know in a practitioners basis we have a lottery ticket in in Brazil and in South Africa because as we've seen back in the 90s and again now these things can move 5060 percent and your risk is probably not much more than the carry I don't know whether I'm going to get paid but with the monetary tightening we're kind of at that stage of the cycle where bombs are</p>
      <p>going off and until the bombs go off in the development markets you would think the tightening will continue and if the tightening continues the bombs will keep going off I would think in emerging markets because there was no more egregious recipient of free money than emerging markets because you had the double whammy a all the vanilla money managers poured money into the place B you had no market's constraints on the political actors I mean the stuff that was going on even a year or two ago I think in you imagine that Argentina issues a hundred year debt a hundred years at 7% I can't even remember a government surviving for five or ten years much less on arrears so you've been intact big tacky you've been right for the right reasons how do you navigate the phenomenal oligopolies that they are profit and machines that they are with what looks like a</p>
      <p>regulatory tidal wave coming at them and how do you decide when to get off that that investment perhaps I should have gotten off of a few weeks ago and I miss my window Karla's hard to figure out I guess let's just take Google okay which is the new bad boy and they're really a bad boy because they didn't show up at the hearing I have an empty chair because they only wanted to send their lawyer but it's 20 times earnings it's probably fifteen times earnings after cash but just say it's 20 times I just forget all other stuff and they're under earning in all these areas and losing money they could turn it off and then I look at Campbell's Soup in this stuff selling it 20 times earnings and you know they're they're the leaders in AI unquestioned</p>
      <p>leaders in AI there's no one close they look like they're the leaders in driverless car and then they just have this unbelievable search machine and one gets emotional when they own stocks when I keep hearing about how horrible they are for consumers I wish everyone that says that would have to use the Yahoo search engine I'm 65 and I'm not too clever and once her why her I hit the wrong button and my PC moves me into Yahoo and Jerry hangs at close friends so I'd say this but these things are so bad and to hear the woman from Denmark say that the proof that that Google is a monopoly and that iPhones don't compete with Android is that everyone uses the Google search engine it's just nonsense you're one click away from any other search engine I just I wish that woman</p>
      <p>would have to use an on Google search engine for a year just okay fine you ain't Google don't use the product because it's a wonderful product but clearly they are monopolies clearly there should be some regulation but at 20 times earnings you know and a lot of bright prospects I I can't make myself sell them yet right now one thing the Chinese Internet's are proving outside of $0.10 they're just reminding us if and when we get in a bear market it doesn't matter what your fundamental learning is our fight you could argue $0.10 okay there's an air pocketing games and we all know what's going on there but Alabama has beat every estimate just none stop and the stocks gone from 210 to 165 it's just a reminder that all these</p>
      <p>estimates where they project out earnings three or four years from now and then they project price to sales based on today's prices sales you know some of these cloud companies are selling at ten times sales if they're selling it six times sales which is not crazy in a normal market by the way I own these things in three or four years I've lost money so it's a challenge it's a challenge I completely missed Apple because I'm not really a value investor and I just looked at that enterprise I don't even think the phone is going to be the medium in five or ten years I don't know it's gonna be in your contact lens or some hologram would so I completely missed that one when you worked with Soros for 12 years one of the things that you said you've learned was focus on capital preservation and taking a really big bet and that many</p>
      <p>many managers make all their money on two or three ideas and they have 40 stocks or 40 assets in their portfolio and it's that concentration that has worked maybe you could go into that a little bit more how that works how many of those concentrated bets did work when you decided to get out if it didn't work do you add when the momentum goes I was up assuming algaas don't interfere with it that's the disclaimer if you're gonna make a bet like that it has to be in a very liquid market even better if it's a liquid market that trades 24 hours a day so most of those bets for me invariably would end up being in the bond and currency markets because I could change from my mind but I've seen like guys</p>
      <p>like Buffett and Carl Icahn do it in the equity markets I just never had the trust in my own analytical abilities to go in an illiquid instrument which inequity is if you're gonna bet on that kind of size on you just you just have to be right and for all the hoopla around mr. Buffett from 98 to 2008 that's a ten year period Berkshire Hathaway that was down 40% nobody talks about that if you had a hedge fund you couldn't have a hedge fund down for ten years forty percent they would have been out of business in here three four somewhere in there but to answer your question I'll get a thesis and I don't really I like to buy not in zero inning and maybe not in the first thing but no later than the second inning and I don't really want to pile on in the third or fourth or fifth inning so I guess examples are the best one</p>
      <p>that I made was which was the gift that kept on giving it was after a funny incident with Soros I had been there six months wasn't clear who was running the fund well it was clear it was him but he was trading very badly and I was trading very badly and I had come from a environment and honestly where people thought I was some kind of superstar and no one had ever questioned me and I flew to Pittsburgh because I had Duquesne at the same time and he blew out my bond position while I was on the plane I'd had total autonomy anywhere I've been my whole career so I basically called him up on a payphone that's what we use back then and resigned when I came back he told me he was gonna go to Eastern Europe for five months and that he</p>
      <p>wouldn't be trading and maybe we were just in each other's hair and he couldn't have two cooks in the kitchen and and let's see whether that was a problem or or if I was really was inept his words not mine so while he was in Eastern Europe the wall came down and I had a very very strong belief that Germans were obsessed with inflation I know that most of them thought Hitler would have never happened if the von Maur Republic thing hadn't happened and when the wall came down and it looks like they're gonna merge with the East Germany the world's thesis was this is gonna be terrible for the deutsche mark my thesis was the Bundesbank is the most powerful institution in germany the public's is obsessed with inflation and they will do</p>
      <p>whatever it takes on the right side to keep that currency strong and there's no way that deutsche mark is going down in fact the place is going to grow like a weed with all this laborer from eastern germany so while he was gone this happened and the deutsche mark gets killed the first two days now here we are in zero inning and I went in very very big right away because the market gave me an opportunity I can't remember what it was down was down three or four percent I thought it should be up ten percent out and then that of course led to this recurring devaluation started with Italy but obviously the pound let's not go over there that's been beat to death Sweden all these things we kept playing and then and there going on and on but there's a case where we never really averaged up and in fact we couldn't</p>
      <p>because we were dealing in those instances with fixed currencies so you don't there's no price momentum you're betting that something's gonna break but in the even against the dollar it's all in right away normally I'll wait for I'll go in with say a third of a position and then wait for price come from and when I get that when I get a technical signal I go I had another very pleasant experience with the successor the deutsche mark which was the Euro I can't remember I think was 2014 when the thing was at 140 and they went to negative interest rates it was very clear they were in a trash at currency and the whole world was long in Iran there we go another years I'd like to say I did it all at 1:39 I did a whole lot but I got a lot more brave when it went through 135 and that that's a more</p>
      <p>normal pattern for me yeah then there would be the strange case of 2000 which is kind of my favorite and involves some kind of lock I had quit quantum and Duquesne was down 15% and I had given up on the year and I went away for four months and I didn't see a financial newspaper in saying so I come back and to my astonishment the Nasdaq has rallied back almost to the high but some other things have happened the price of oil has gone up the dollars going way up and it's rates going up since I was on my sabbatical and I knew that normally this particular cocktail had always been negative for earnings and the US economy so I then went about calling 50 of my clients they stayed with me during my sabbatical who were all small business men I didn't really have institutional</p>
      <p>clients I had all these little businessman and every one of them said their business was terrible so I'm taking this is interesting and the two-year is yielding 6:04 not that I would remember and Fed Funds were six and a half so I start buying very large positions in two and five year US Treasuries then I explained my thesis to Heinemann and i thought that was the end of it and three days later he's run aggression analysis with the dollar interest rates in oil what happens to S&P earnings and it spit out a year later S&P earnings should be down 25% and the street had them up 18 so I keep buying these Treasuries and Greenspan keeps giving these hawkish speeches and they have a bias to tighten that and I'm almost getting angry and every time he gives a speech I keep buying more and</p>
      <p>more and more and that turned out to be one of the best bets I ever mayne again there was no price movement I just had such a fundamental belief so sometimes it's price sometimes it's just such a belief from the fundamentals but for me I've never trusted myself to go put 30 or 40 percent of my fund in inequity I mean I did it when I was managing eight hundred thousand dollars which is what I started with but not a nun in the illiquid position one of the great things I understand you do is when you've had a down year normally fund manager would want to get aggressive to to win and win it back and which you you've told me that you do you you take a lot of little bets that won't hurt you and to get back to the to break even it makes the tremendous amount of sense maybe you could just explore that a little bit with me yeah one of one of the lucky things was the way my industry</p>
      <p>prices is you price on in at the end of the year you take a percentage or whatever profit made for that year so at the end of the year psychologically and financially you reset to zero last year his profits are yesterday's news so I would always be a crazy person when I was down in a year but I know because I like to gamble that in Las Vegas 90 the people that go there loose and the odds are only 33 to 32 against you in most of the big game so how can I have sent lose it's because they want to go home and brag that they won money so when they're winning and they're hot they're very very cautious and when they're cold and losing money they're betting big because they want to go home and tell their wife or their friends</p>
      <p>they made money which is completely irrational so and this is important because I don't think anyone has ever said it before now one of my most important jobs as a money manager was to understand whether I was hot or cold life goes in streaks and like a hitter in baseball sometimes a money manager is seeing the ball and sometimes they're not and if you're imagining money you must know whether you're cold or hot and in my opinion when you're cold you should be trying for months it shouldn't be swinging for the fences you got to get back back in a rhythm so that's pretty much how I operate it if I was down I had not earned the right to play big and the little bets you're talking about were simply on to tell me had I reestablished a rhythm and was was I starting to make hits again the example I gave you of the Treasury bet in 2000</p>
      <p>it's a total violation of that which shows you how much conviction I had so this dominates my thinking but if a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity comes along um you can't sit there and go oh whoa I have not earned the right now I will also say that was after a four-month break right my mind was fresh my mind was clean and I will go to my grave believing if I hadn't taken that sabbatical I would have never seen that in September and I would have never made that bet it's because I had been freed up and I didn't need to be hitting singles because I came back and it was clear and I was fresh and so that's kind of it was like the beginning of the season so I wasn't I wasn't hitting bad yet I had flushed that all out but it is really really important if you're money manager to know when you're seeing the ball yeah it's a huge function of success or</p>
      <p>failure huge so when you made that that trade you just described there was a huge amount of conviction and and historical proof that this had always worked so today as we look at the US equity market that's gone up four to almost ten straight years and our performance has been dramatic what would you need to see to give you the conviction to want to go short well unfortunately I have gone short several times this year and at least I'm alive but I regret having news so I looked seasonals in july/august and I looked at the background of the I had no precedent for a balance sheet rate of change going down a trillion dollars from where I've been but that gave me the conviction to go short on top of the fact that seasonally I had a trustee period that also sort of rhymed with right when the</p>
      <p>slope of the curve of the QE was shrinking it didn't work I got a bloody nose and you know and now we contemplating my future but everything for me has never been about earnings it's never been about politics it's always about liquidity and my assumption is one of these hikes I don't know which one it's going to trigger this thing and I am on triple ran alert because we're not only in the timeframe we're in the part and maybe markets don't anticipate the way they used to I thought markets would anticipate there's no more euro ECB money spilling over into the US equity market at the end of the year so this is a good time to take a shot clearly it wasn't if we get a blow off in the fourth quarter which seasonally</p>
      <p>tends to happen particularly in Nasdaq talk markets particularly if these bombs keep going off in emerging markets I could see myself taking a big shot somewhere around year-end but you know that's a long way off on I'll cross that bridge when I come to right now I'm just licking my wounds from the last shot I took well we have JG bees which have been the most amazing vehicle I'm we're back in the in the late 90s everybody's favorite short was JG bees and I think I found it jumped on the bandwagon at one point but the thought was that the jgb was the outlier but the jgb was really the leader absolutely that was that was what we all missed but then we when I figured that out so we got to minus 30 I think on the tenure on the jgv which I thought had to be as short but it would have been I mean it was a year or two I</p>
      <p>would have been dead money now it looks like yields are breaking out of the jgb I don't know if you agree with that it looks like something is going on Kuroda is accepting perhaps that it's not working and they need to change and them having been the most egregious of all the central bank's is that a really important change for the world it's part of the puzzle I'm talking about in and of itself I don't know but since it looks like it could be happening by the end of the year if not sooner and it looks like at the same time the ECB will stop buying bonds but it looks like at the same time we'll be shrinking our balance sheet 50 billion a month it's an important all these pieces fit together for reckoning I'm not in the business of making a fortune if something goes from ten basis points to 20 basis points that</p>
      <p>really that's not something I'm gonna make a big bet on I mean I might have a short on don't use myself for something like that right but I do think it's very important in terms of this overall narrative it's also instructive why they're doing it right because it looks like Temari they're not doing it for economic reasons they finally understand that it's killing their banks which is the blood and the oxygen you need to run the economic body right and that's causing a political problem I sure hope we don't need 25 years of that kind of evidence before we normalize right but I think I Carol I think it's very important but only as a piece in an overall puzzle they're all lying in the same direction which is why I made the bet short in July and you know was wrong at least on a trading basis but</p>
      <p>psychologically I'm still there it's going to be the shrinkage and liquidity of the triggers this thing and frankly it's already triggered at in emerging markets and that's kind of where it always starts where I haven't seen it yet and where I think should happen for the equity and God knows talk about a crazy price market is the credit market and it's amazing then probably since the 1880s 1890's this is the most disruptive economic period in history there's hardly any bankruptcies so whatever that buffett line about swimming naked with the tide there's probably so many zombies swimming out there and there's going to be some level of liquidity that triggers it who knows it might start with Tesla I don't know but it's I mean could this Tesla thing have happened in any other environment in history I don't think so it's just ridiculous</p>
      <p>what's going on there in the last few weeks but I don't look at it so much as Tesla it just describes the environment to me it's nuts right and all the the malinvestment and the trillions of dollars that were spent without a cash return and you just can't imagine how many zombies there really are out there and a corporation's buying back their stock to the tune of five trillion running down their balance sheets and then you go to the high-yield market where it's covenant light and a huge amount of issuance what happens when interest rates start to reflect credit risk you know intuitively you can make a case that we're gonna have a financial crisis bigger than the last one because all they did was triple down on what my opinion costed Bernanke and I have a big disagreement over what caused that crisis but to me the seeds of it were</p>
      <p>born in a three-room we had nine percent nominal growth in the fourth quarter and we had one percent rate which wasn't even enough he had that stupid considerable period thing attached to it and you had serious serious malinvestment you know for three or four years subprime was pretty easy to identify if you had the right people showing you which I was lucky enough to have had them come in I don't know who the boogeyman is this time I do know that there's zombies out there are they going to infect the banking system the way they did last time I don't know what it what I do know is we seem to learn something from every crisis and this one we didn't learn anything in my opinion we tripled down on what caused the crisis and we tripled down on it globally tried to solve the problem of debt with more debt exactly which is what we did in the 20s and that didn't work out with Wall Street just cheering them on cheering them on well we've got this huge entitlement issue which you've</p>
      <p>read a lot about 100 trillion of unfunded liabilities Medicare Medicaid Social Security five times US GDP just as bad in the rest of the world worst demographics in 500 years dependency ratios rising you're going to have a battle between creditors and debtors at some point up to now the creditors have been winning but they're starting to lose lose a couple and when that plays out we're gonna have some really tough times which brings me to this whole idea of a populism and I want to kind of bring them all together so I started following populism back in 2011 that's when I felt it was coming then we had Raziel I came back from Beijing in October 2012 and was clear to me that the new leadership we didn't know about she that he'd be appointed but we we knew what they were planning to do which was to clamp down on the corruption to save the Communist</p>
      <p>Party and the word was that we used to describe it as given give a little bit now rather than a lot later having studied in French and Russian revolutions unfortunately an America that that didn't happen so it's just gotten more wealth disparity so populism some people think is represented by Trump and other people have it in different theories my feeling is populism is really about wealth divided and an unequal sharing in in the economy so for 30 years the the worker didn't get a real wage increase now you're starting to get some of it but it's being taken away through higher cost of living so when we look at this whole debt situation we also have to look at it in in the context of populist sentiment and credit redditor versus debtor and I may be ahead of myself here but how do you</p>
      <p>how do you see all that working out first of all I think you nailed the cause of it because the the previous populist periods we have required much worse aggregate economic statistics to set them off but when I was running Soros a year end for the first few years we had a fixed system as a percentage of the profits and the rage where the high performers felt about the low performers even though they were all ridiculously overpaid taught me that Envy is one of the strongest human emotions and when you look at the wealth disparity today which by the way in my opinion the biggest accelerant of has been QE it's</p>
      <p>it's not even like that it's kneadable and then you have the internet broadcasting this disparity through millions of bits of information on an ongoing basis I personally think Jeff Bezos deserves every penny he has I think it's one of the great companies ever but you know there have been 20 articles in the last 48 hours I promise you on that he's worth more than a hundred and fifty billion dollars I mean how does it how does a normal citizen look at that and he's not contemplated exactly so I think that is the seed of it it's not some economic malaise it's it's it's the disparity but the disparity has never been worse and probably one of the most disturbing books I've ever read was Charles Maurice coming apart yes and I read that and I said oh my god this is gonna get worse</p>
      <p>and it can't stop it's just built into this system the irony being what really set it off is when these universities became meritocracy as I said an old boy network and then you sort of have inbreeding between the men and I'm going to Harvard and they all live in the same zip codes and I'm looking at this so I'm going oh my god this is my family and you know it comes home so I don't see what stops this until you end up with some major major dislocations politically and economically because of it you know the Trump comment it's interesting because had Bernie Sanders won the nomination every poll that spring had Hillary running about even with Trump just no one believed it they all had Bernie Sanders 18 points ahead of try and Bernie Sanders was not losing Michigan and Pennsylvania and all those units and Bernie Sanders was also</p>
      <p>a populist so I agree with you it's not about Trump Trump is clearly a populist don't get me wrong yeah but and it's too global and it's happening everywhere and McCrone was probably a a short-term response to Trump but other than McCrone there's just been surprise after surprise after surprise to the elites on these elections and you wonder why they're surprised anymore well you know my theory on Bernie Sanders is that he was they used sort of internal politics to deny him the nomination that he should have won and had he won the nomination he would have beaten Trump so we would have had that shift already this leads me to the what's going on now and that is America's shift towards nationalism at least under Trump the rest of the world is focusing on maintaining</p>
      <p>multilateral alignments Japan is just signed the biggest trade free trade deal with the EU Mexico has TPP is powering ahead we have the China's one belt there's a lot of controversy about it but I think it's a tremendous vision I think it's real and I understand why they're doing it yes which is destined to win in the end the answer is I don't know probably the most destructive thing Trump has done in the global trading system is once he figured out how powerful a weapon the US banking system was and how powerful sanctions are but he doesn't understand that that weapon was created and is so powerful because from the Marshall Plan on we have been the only country that all the others no matter how they might</p>
      <p>bad novels are that trusted to do the right thing we're we're the only nation in history that handled success the way we did and yes you should use this weapon once in a while but when you start just shooting it all over the place and you're now shooting at it you know it Canada Europe and here there that's a lot different than shooting it at Iran or Russia exactly and he's like a little kid that found this water gun and he's just wearing on going all over the place with it and the the biggest danger I see is we lose that trust that America is good and in the end they're going to do the right thing I don't think it can be lost in four years I really don't know but if Trump is re-elected or maybe even worse if another populist on the very hard left is reelected and they they use the</p>
      <p>weapon the same way I think by 24 which by the way is exactly when the teittleman thing will start to get crazy this thing could be very bad I'm quite open-minded let's see who the Democrats put up let's see if Trump's in office but I don't think the world will give up on us in four years I think I'm open-minded to Trump having been a one-off and the trade system can survive this but it's a it's not like that's an 80% probability job it's just well it's probably somewhere between 40 and 55 that it works out it's sad for sure the whole supply chain issue is phenomenally interesting and complicated and I'm concerned that the administration doesn't understand the complexities of it and by trying to pull out all of the</p>
      <p>sensitive components from China and relocate them to the US or to Vietnam or whoever else is so immensely disruptive and dangerous and then you start a process so I was in during the worst part first part of the the first meetings between the Chinese Americans others and Beijing I was also in in South Korea and I met with Samsung and already China was moving very aggressively to create its own semiconductor industry was investing 150 billion which of course has ramped up 10 times faster and I asked him some what are you going to do with the Americans forbade you to sell semiconductors would you continue to do so and I was told that they would but they would also help China build its own industry even though it's going to cannibalize them so I see</p>
      <p>these trends that are taking place that won't be reversed and Europe which would normally be an ally of America to try to hold back China's advances is now being forced more towards China and these aren't things that are going to shift back because once you start to take these positions is really you know you're not going to reverse yourself I agree with you on the semiconductors and again it emphasizes of what you talked about earlier which is sort of now policies even if they worked and I can make an argument that it won't even work because if you just disrupt supply chains everything's gonna blow up yeah but you've now you've absolutely put in force the creation of Chinese semiconductor industry that didn't need to happen the time frame that's going to happen I think there's been enough frustration with the Chinese that the</p>
      <p>Europeans could look at this as a one-off and be right back with our allies as our allies again but know that you're right there are a lot of other things that are set in force that we're not going back to and I think you can make a good argument that some of the aspects of the China situation are a fight worth fighting you can also make an argument that not but they're not a fight worth fighting without Europe and Canada and all these allies we would have had that that's just if you want to take on China and again fair people can debate on on whether that should be done if you want to take on China you can do it with a united front you don't do it by alienating all your partners as the process gets underway especially when the u.s. is a net debtor to the tune of a trillion is running</p>
      <p>fiscal deficits that are close to what they were in 2009 I think we have full employment at full employment and I mean III if we're in a recession that thing could go to two trillion and a heartbeat that's when deficit explodes yeah sorry to interrupt if we have a recession yeah and I think we're we're rolling over if I remember correctly something like 10 trillion of nominal and new each each year we sold a hundred and thirty billion in in July which is a record since two thousand eight or nine and so the whole owners of our of our dad are the very people that were having a trade war yes it seems a little ironic to me well it is what it is you know so let's move over to your philanthropy and your</p>
      <p>passions there and what you're most interested in and and what's happening that's exciting and you're neuroscience and stem cell work you know in general Fiona and I didn't want to give to the arts we don't have anything against the arts we think they're wonderful but they seem to be extremely well supported relative to the utility society gets out of them so our our big areas and I'll get to your question specifically were at-risk youth education the environment and health and the neuroscience and the stem cell are both Fiona's original idea not mine we both think that the brain is sort of the last frontier in terms of rapid advances with the body and it's</p>
      <p>been extremely frustrating so far with the autism and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and we're both convinced me by Fiona Fiona by a lot of research that this problem with the right funding can be solved over the next say 20 years and great advance is going to be made not dissimilar or what started going on with cancer 7 or 10 years ago so that's pretty much the thought on neuroscience and stem cells we've non anonymously we've we've funded the neuroscience Center and obviously NYU and a lot of the basic research and we've also funded anonymously some of the more applied research and others too but we find them both very exciting and why you seemed like the perfect place because they have a great aggressive leader in Bob Grossman that's sort of a necessary requirement as anything we invest in I mean I don't think it's an</p>
      <p>accident that that place has gone from like 40th to third in medical school rankings since Langone got involved in broad grossman awards just ridiculous I mean the only people out of them now are Harvard and Johns Hopkins and I think they were considered average as late as 15 years ago and then of course stem cells are another great hope in all these areas and I know Fiona was very enthralled with Susan Solomon and what they were creating in the bang for their buck so in both cases we went for an area that we thought showed great potential in terms of progress and we picked institutions which we thought was very strong innovative leaders who couldn't who could execute on the proposition frankly if some other institution solves the problem I'll be thrilled I don't really care I'm sure</p>
      <p>you saw what NYU did with the medical school I would also be well it wouldn't be the greatest outcome for NYU I think even the people who run in weiu our dream would be that starts an arms race because the brain drain going out of medicine and to less productive things like my business and and and the tech world social social media and things has been horrendous because by the time these kids go through four years of premed medical school residency and then fellowships they usually don't start earning money until their mid-thirties and they got 500,000 dead and now you can be making 2 or 3 million a year and my business with a lot less preparation at the age of 27 or 28 so I really hope Harvard with their 40 billion endowment or whatever it is and</p>
      <p>the others decide that they can't they can't let my you just grab all the great medical students so in terms of defeating Alzheimer's and dementia have you've gotten far enough along to know what what the formula is - I had on yeah I have there's all sorts of theories out there and some of the drugs right now that that attack amyloid I mean I mean I know Biogen had a resurgence and this company we actually own in switzerland caught on on you and those drugs would be a bridge the ultimate solution i think would have to be something different and Fiona knows a lot more on the subject than me and she's pretty optimistic that they're gonna solve this thing in twenty years more and more of</p>
      <p>our friends are showing up in the dementia even at young ages yeah and you watch how debilitating it is and it's incredibly depressing we've seen it it didn't happen before we started the neuroscience Center but we've seen it up close and personal and uh it's tragic just tragic and very very very painful really hoping and even though you're seeing in younger ages we're all living longer so it's manifesting itself more and more just simply because humans are living to age of say they used to and every part of the body has seemed to have kept up with the progress except the brain is that they're not going to be doing brain transplants so we got to fix this directly how would you like to be remembered what's the most important thing when you look back in your life is this is how I want people to remember me I don't know how important that is to me but since you asked the question I just I've been so blessed</p>
      <p>being an industry with just crazy financial renumeration relative society's benefits and obviously I was given a gift on I was a good student but there were certainly smarter kids in me I I just have a gift of compounding money I'd like to think that I made a difference with that and I guess if people are remembering things I'd like to be remembering as as not some loud ostentatious overly consumptive person in the mean time but I think I thank God I married Fiona because she wasn't from a lot of money but she had old money and she taught me to behave in a way I probably wouldn't know from the get-go when I see some of my peers and I'd like to avoid that stamp of a sure sure now we have a president who seems to have exceeded that culture just so I</p>
      <p>guess that would be it just that I made a difference in live at least a life for some humility well you surely have and I think you've gonna help a lot of people with your insights today and thank you very much for joining us here giving us your time fun it was really a lot of fun Stan Druckenmiller is the most requested guest in the history of real vision myself included we've all wanted to see and learn how he does things because his track record is extraordinary and the brilliance of the man is something that doesn't come across enough in television because there's never an in-depth interview you just don't know that much about him but I'm so pleased that Kiril managed to flesh out what makes Stan Stan what makes him think in how he does things there is so much learning for all of us in this and it's truly an honor for us to have had Carol conduct an interview and I really hope you enjoyed</p>
      <p>it as much as I did and I cannot wait to see also who Carol brings next to real vision it's going to be somebody legendary you</p>

      <p>for those that missed it earlier this year's sewn corporate sponsor tigas has come up with a fun idea for sewn attendees they've offered to Source a custom expert call for anyone in this own audience which you can do at tegus.com sewn hopefully some of those calls will be used to investigate the ideas that have been presented so far today we move now to an incredibly interesting interview Stan druckenmiller is the founder CEO and chairman of the Duquesne family office he's one of the most successful and legendary investors of all time with an incredible investing track record across decades and through a variety of Market environments he's also a student of history and I'm sure that his ideas today will be sobering informative and balanced Sam aldman said earlier that he tries not to make macro predictions but Stan is in that business so I expect some macro thoughts that will leave us all thinking Stan is being interviewed by Carol sokoloff the founder of 13d research and strategy Carol 2 is a student of markets in history and brings Decades of perspective making him the perfect</p>
      <p>person to steer the conversation and get into the most important topics with Stan gentlemen over to you it's always such a great pleasure to be with you I can't think of anyone in the world I'll talk to you right now last year you told me you thought the U.S recession would arrive in the last half of 23. or early 24 but he recently told me that he brought your recession forecast forward you're hearing lots of anecdotal information from the CEOs you talked to problems in trucking problems in retail obviously credit contraction issues and you believe that the consensus of a staff Landing is very unlikely and you rate the probabilities of a hard Landing as white after all how could we not have a hard Landing after 11 years of the greatest monetary stimulus in U.S history</p>
      <p>a 500 basis point increases short rates over the past year the developing real estate crisis in commercial real estate Regional banks have 33 percent of their allowance in that sector and the bursting of the everything could you please elaborate on this thank you Carol always good to see you um you conveniently left out um part of the punch line which was when we talked I told you that I've been doing this for 45 years I have to make economic forecasts for a living and this is easily the most challenging period you have a confident forecast I've had in my career you've just articulated some of the reasons um the extreme monetary policy and then the abrupt change but covered figures kind of mess everything up I'm trying to figure out</p>
      <p>what what the momentum coming out of covid is is just that and is real or is not real or sustainable or it's not sustainable then you go through Ukraine war then you've got the whole China reopening so I I want to qualify anything I say it was saying in terms of confidence um it's not as much as I would usually have not that uh economic forecasting is is an exact science anyway but but we do know a few things um thanks to you it was your recommendation I read Edward Chancellor's the price of time um as you know I've been saying for years that my observation was the worst uh economic outcomes tended to follow asset bubbles I was only looking uh at the past hundred years or so and</p>
      <p>um Edward Chancellor's book and in a real tour de force describes how this has been going on for over 500 years and basically every time you've had interest rates below two percent going back 500 years it's generally been followed um with with difficult Economic Times so if you look at the the current menu um I think it was actually just just a little over two years ago I went on national television and said we had monetary policy that was the most Reckless and extreme relative the economic circumstances I had ever seen and at that time inflation was two and a half percent you had a booming economy you were coming out because covet and it was clear both vaccine that we were we were on our way to maybe the most rapid recovery I had seen in my lifetime</p>
      <p>um I was not surprised about a year later than an inflation reached nine percent I was not surprised that specs went crazy Bitcoin went crazy Dogecoin went crazy uh equities went crazy what I was surprised by was that for the next year while all that happened um Jerome Powell's fed continued to have their foot on the gas they continued to buy 120 billion dollars a bond a month while rates were zero um this obviously led to everything I described then um realizing they had probably made the biggest mistake in the history of the FED they slammed on the brakes um they've raised rates 500 basis points in the last year um we know historically two things which you've already articulated number one</p>
      <p>um the worst economic outcomes tend to follow uh too easily engineered um asset Bubbles and number two big maximum my business don't fight the Fed so I'm sitting here staring in the face at the biggest asset and probably the broadest asset bubble forget that I've ever seen that I've ever studied it went on for 10 or 11 years and then it's the grand finale um the government spent 5 trillion on coved the FED financed 60 percent of it and as I just described now we now we have a big hike in interest rates um it's hard to look at that constellation of factors know that we've only had a few soft Landings since 1950 all of them were preceded by what I would call Proactive rather than reactive fed policy</p>
      <p>and believe we're going to have a soft Landing one never knows but if you're just looking at the odds they're very tough in terms of the timing um I have left much less certainty on that than I do on whether we're going to have a hard Landing or a soft Landing the timing is difficult but I will say you've already noted in our shop we tend to use anecdotal information a lot it's somewhat mixed um housing which has tended to lead historically is actually um fairly fairly robust um travel restaurants stuff like that is fairly robust but other stuff um Trucking which has been a Guiding Light for my firms in terms of economic forecasting with a six to eight month lead time um actually since I got in the business is extremely weak we're hearing bad bad anecdotes from retail and then of course you have the you've already mentioned it</p>
      <p>the the banking problem we always knew um given what I've already described there are going to be bodies out there when you have free money um people do stupid things when you have free money for 11 years people do really stupid things so there's stuff under the hood it's starting to emerge obviously the regional Banks recently we had Bed Bath and Beyond but I would assume there's a lot more bodies coming the regional Banks the median Regional Bank has 43 percent of their um loans in commercial real estate about 40 percent of that is office as you know we've had this huge change in lifestyle um due to coven number one the great resignation but number two people are going to the office so we have actually a higher vacancy rate than we had in 2008 so I put all that together</p>
      <p>and I look also at the inverted yield curve the timing has always said sort of third to probably fourth quarter of this year to first quarter of 24 but the recent anecdotes the banking problems I wouldn't be surprised if the bean counters a year from now as they tend to do backward looking that the thing started sometime in the second quarter I don't know that but I do this for a living so I gotta have a forecast well thank you for that and given all the uncertainties and the difficulty of happening having an addiction what is a hard Landing look like and we're the greatest risks and how do you best mitigate those things who the outcome the stationary or def station or a combination of the two but we spoke about this a year ago I argued that 18 trillion in Sovereign</p>
      <p>credit with the negative yield and interest rates at 5 000 units low 5 000 your lows was a really deflationary extreme on the other hand for years you've argued that the surest way to create deflation is to build an asset bubble and then burst it and we're the fourth grade Super Bubble of the last 100 years so how does this end and what are the implications of another round of massive monitored statements well the easy answer to your question and the most truthful one is I don't know um but I'll give it a shot first of all when I talk about a hard Landing I'm talking about something albeit starting from near record margins it probably encompasses a say a 20 to 20 percent plus with an emphasis on the plus decline in corporate profits um unemployment</p>
      <p>probably going up from the 3.4 right now to something above five um probably a number of increases in bankruptcies which as you know Carol are astonishingly low given that we've been in one of the most disruptive economic periods since the 1880s and until recently there have been basically no bankruptcies and they're nowhere near where they were in 2008 um in terms of inflation or deflation wow that is really hard um two years ago I was pretty confident inflation was going to go up and go up materially now it's funny uh we had a staff meeting last week and I said I could make a case in three years for inflation being an eight or I can make a case for deflation that's kind of a</p>
      <p>that's kind of a wide range in terms of giving an answer but I would say um the hardest thing looking at all this is sort of looking at the money supply so edheim and who have unbelievable respect for has pointed out that we have the most rapid shrinkage in the money supply we've ever had but it's not that simple because the money supply grew in the high 30s around 40 percent a few years ago so if you look at the stock of money it's still extremely high so if you make this big mountain and you just come down a little like this um yes the year to year over change in the money supply is like minus six percent but there's still a lot of liquidity out there I think Jamie dimon said a year and a half ago there was like two and a half trillion in excess deposits uh and savings</p>
      <p>uh we've worked probably a trillion a trillion and a half of that out but there's still a stock out there so trying to time this is difficult but putting it all together giving anecdotes given the fact that we are on our way with long and variable lags we're already a year into it I would guess inflation will probably come down into the three three and a half percent range in the next six to nine months and that's when it gets really hard because then you're asking me to predict what the FED will do and I just told you I was astonished at what the FED response was in 2000 and um 21 and even in early 2022 and in case no one knows next year is an election year if they act like Arthur burns when it goes down to three or three and a half percent and you haven't had enough time where inflation is down and they don't and they haven't slayed the dragon that's where I could see a few years out</p>
      <p>sort of an inflationary probably with an emphasis on the Stag part A stagflationary environment um or I am haunted by the previous things I've said and the fact that we've had this massive asset bubble if you burst it um there's a possibility that they can't put Humpty Dumpty back together again if there's one thing about the consensus that I'd say I'm on the other side of and I want to be careful with my words here um it's this constant repeating that this looks like nothing like 2008 or 2007. first of all those saying it I don't remember them predicting in 2007 what was ahead of them and I don't remember people saying the banking system was that week going in um I I am not predicting something worse than</p>
      <p>2008 so I don't want to see headlines tomorrow that I said something worse in 2008 is coming but I think it's naive to not be open-minded to some sort of possibility that affect the the banks have got themselves in a balance sheet problem um before the loan losses have started because of um obviously the mismatch of liabilities and assets with treasuries on their balance sheet they're basically have stuff yielding two two and a half percent that their cost of funds is five percent on so before we even get into an economic attraction many of the banks already have impaired balance sheets if you pile on um losses in commercial real estate credit card losses the stuff that normally happens in recessions and you take the fact that we have had this big asset bubble going into it and you take the fact that we just had the most rapid increase in interest rates</p>
      <p>from the bottom in in history I think it's just naive not be open-minded to something really really bad happening again it is not my forecast but as a risk manager it has to be part of my Matrix and my equation and thinking about it absolutely well let's let's go down that train of thought in a hard Landing what asset classes would perform best and of course during the uh the time of nifty fifty seventies as the uh that bubble burst in 72-74. this so-called basic industry stocks went flat didn't get anything wrong and once the FED started cutting and cutting you know in 75 they uh the absolutely soared likewise during the early 2000s the internet Bubble Burst Commodities and commodity equities especially oil held up well and of course we're the leaders in ensuing decades so the natural inclination is to</p>
      <p>reduce exposure to Commodities if a hard landing were coming but history shows that that doesn't always work so as you're doing you're thinking board how do you evaluate how much exposure to happen in these sectors and what events or Market action would make you want to take a very large position well you notice the period you went right to was the period I just also mentioned which was the arthur Burns ring and with the OPEC increase in 1973 and I think oil went up 400 percent and then Burns taking his foot off the brakes too early obviously chemicals oils stuff like that and it's sort of a wonderful period I don't think this is all that different again it's going to depend a lot on government and policy makers response if we get a hard Landing but</p>
      <p>one would think coming out of it um they're going to be some great Commodities copper is in the tightest position well frankly I've ever even studied I'm actually afraid to have a meaningful position in it at this point as we approach the hard Landing um only because I'm not an idiot and I know what what happened to the cyclical factors as a hard Landing starts but coming out of it um given the move toward EVS um given the usefulness of it and infrastructure spending which I think a lot of government policies will try and encourage on their way out um it's hard to believe copper won't be a huge beneficiary the question is um when I was when am I supposed to buy it and how big is the exposure and a lot of how big I would get a position like</p>
      <p>that again will be policy makers response if we even get a hard Landing this isn't a four conclusion as I said earlier this is not an easy forecast place to forecast the other interesting place um is the U.S Housing Industry because housing has obviously gone down dramatically um given the 500 basis point increase in interest rates but we unlike 0.708 we actually have a structural shortage in single handling single-family homes going into this so if things got bad enough I could actually see housing which is about the last thing you would you would think of intuitively could be a big beneficiary on the way out and then um I would say there's always growth and this is really hard to figure out which names but biotech has been a big</p>
      <p>underperformer in the last three to five years and there are tremendous things going on in cancer and other areas there's an article um I guess it was in The Economist uh last weekend about um new viral drugs using viruses to conquer bacteria so that would be a fruitful area and then of course there's AI um I would hope that I haven't been one to buy into fads historically I I played some Bitcoin at the bottom but never really got too too worked up about blockchain um I did I did buy the top and uh 2000 um in an emotional moment in in the tech bubble after having sold it but um I actually think um yeah I think is very very real real and could be every bit as impactful as the internet literally</p>
      <p>um going forward and it could be a beautiful opportunity in a hard Landing just like oh 102 were a beautiful opportunity when the tech Bubble Burst going forward for companies who benefit from the internet um AI could be there it's funny um my firm has only been able to participate in AI by owning Nvidia and Microsoft and it's not even clear to me and this is kind of this is kind of out there Carol but it's not even clear to me if we had a really bad recession that Nvidia would even go down um it's kind of a stupid statement um given giving them multiple on it but if they bought Staples historically in recessions why wouldn't they grow a company that's obvious by a company that's obviously going to grow very rapidly so those are just some interesting thoughts I mean we own</p>
      <p>we own gold and silver right now they historically have not done well in hard Landings but given the the it looks to me like the monetary and the fiscal authorities are kind of at the end of their rope and given the fact that other countries have decided particularly autographies not to hold their reserves in dollars um I'm betting for the time being uh against the history of the performance of gold and hard Landings um could be wrong and then don't go out and buy gold I could change my mind in a week or two folks but um those are just some thoughts to it to a very hard question I would say the most important answer I give that is keep an open mind and see how the authorities react to this over the six to nine months because they could give you very different outcomes but be open-minded to your question</p>
      <p>we're given the the boom bus that the fat has created for decades the free money of the last decade the excessive postcoded period and now the risk of a hard Landing if one were to uh do you think the independence of the FED is in jeopardy and would it be a fatal bloat utility case for simple facts you asked really hard questions Carol um I think the fed's independence Will Survive uh I will say it'll be the most risk of that Independence um that I will have seen in 50 years so it's not a slam dunk I think there's a five to ten percent chance if the hard</p>
      <p>lending got really bad and people looked back at the record of the fed the last five or ten years you already hear people screaming about 500 basis points and the FED has gone too far and what are they doing um and this is with unemployment at 3.4 percent 2024 an election year um if things get really bad and they look at the actual record the guy blew 40 Years of credibility in terms of disinflationary mindset and then like a reformed smoker Maybe if we have a hard Landing people say he over adjusted and was wrong again it's going to come under attack I hope and believe their independence Will Survive but it's not an unreasonable question I believe certainly isn't moving on to</p>
      <p>what the government will do in a recession in terms of of stimulus is it possible that we've seen literally the end of the credit cycle and then no more balance sheets left too right it's possible but these guys never cease to amaze me yeah um I don't think they'll go down without a fight we have we come into this with fiscal challenges completely unlike any time we've ever been in this situation before I remember um in 79 and 80 when Reagan wrote in on his white horse you know the market was eight times earnings um prices were depressed and balance sheets particularly the governments were nowhere near in the situation they're in now so there's</p>
      <p>there's not the room to move in on the monetary or the fiscal front in a reasonable manner that there's been going into other Cycles we basically wasted all our bullets amazingly in the last few years in in an economic expansion um but you know the government can always print money and try look at look at what they did in Japan I mean they tried everything and it didn't work uh the question is are we there the answer is I hope not going back to Edward Chancellor and you were kind enough to with Scott Besson here in my Branch West in January and you asked the question uh who's our current Society so addicted to government and Central Bank and asked him that it's impossible to work our way way out of this</p>
      <p>and you asked Edward when you thought it was when past the point of no return and he said he thought we had what do you think I would never just categorically say we pass a point in no return but you know I was worried about our fiscal situation so worried about it that 12 years ago I went out and tried to convince young people on a college tour of what lay ahead of us and was worried about the 2025 to 3035 period because of the demographics of the situation and what might happen with interest expense um frankly um the period since then has been worse than I ever imagined so um I don't want to go quite so far as Edward went but let me just say I'm concerned I don't</p>
      <p>know I'm concerned I it is amazing how America has this culture that always seems to respond and come back and maybe with a hard landing and a flush out and just a terrible recession that brings back the values and the culture we've all had we come out of this on the other side but I mean it's a it's a it's a scary cocktail that we're being presented with yeah yeah I know so looking at how you navigate these tricky markets and you've been saying for a year that being short is very dangerous because of these brutal bear Market ballots but if you're a standard in long short hedge fund how do you position yourself oh Carol I like um I like concentrated bets I like fat</p>
      <p>pitches and then the swing big and I also like when you don't see a fat pitch stand there and let the pitches go by um two years ago two years at 15 basis points with a money growing at 40 percent money supply growing at 40 percent that was a fat pitch um your risk reward was maybe if you're dead wrong the two-year yield goes from 15 basis points to 10 basis points I thought at the time if I was right they would go to 200 I have to admit I didn't think they were going to go to 500 in a year I didn't think the FED had it in them um I don't see a pitch like that out there right now I was also very negative on the stock market um and I'm not positive on the stock market but we've come a long way I'm afraid of the authorities um</p>
      <p>and if I like the stock market you know I would be exposed and I'm not exposed to it so my advice would be to a long short hedge fund keep your gross low be open-minded and if we get a hard Landing um there are going to be unbelievable opportunities and I don't want to miss those opportunities by blowing my money now and having some 20 or 30 percent loss where my head is all screwed up when those opportunities presents himself so I'm happy um with with a with a portfolio right now that is not net short or not in that long and only about 60 percent gross because funny things happen when you need chaos you know the The Playbook I've always used if I expected a bad economic outcome is to own treasuries well with with 10-year yielding 350 or</p>
      <p>wherever it is today um and fed funds at five that's not exactly a fat pitch what if you're wrong um and what if what if the FED panics can you get an inflationary outcome so that asset class is sort of off the table um we can talk about the dollar in a few minutes I don't have some massive short dollar position I may have been a little misinterpreted uh in an interview I did a week ago but I but it is a position that will move the needle at my firm uh I don't know how long I'm going to stick with it but that that is something we're doing but for for long short guys out there I would say you're going to have unbelievable opportunities in the next couple years there's a lot of dispersion um within Industries and just make sure just make sure to preserve your Capital until they present themselves and I wouldn't go crazy on the short side for</p>
      <p>that reason either but I said so let's come back to a point you raised earlier and go into more detail on it and that's the U.S fiscal situation so the first quarter of this year we saw the third largest deficit in history uh exceeded only by the coveted quarter and and TFC and what happens in a recession or hard Landing can be deficit and the U.S didn't extend the Charities would have had a chance and now uh interest uh federal debt is running out of 600 billion annual rate even during 2018 when unemployment hit a 50-year low the deficit never even fell below five percent and then in the post-coded boom which you referred to as being something you've never seen before the US government ran a deficit of over a trillion and never in history has a boom economy produced the worst physical result</p>
      <p>there's a lot of talk about the destiny but you're concerned for years has been next ability of this entitled expense and by some estimates the present value of undefined government liabilities is its highest 200 trillion and one CEO study shows that entitlements plus net interest will cost 100 of taxes in 2040. so we've all out your thinking on this which you've been talking about for a long time well first of all the the debt ceiling debate is is really depressing um look I hope um we don't have a technical default I think it would be stupid I think it would be a market event I think it would be a problem but it's just amazing all the catastrophic forecasts</p>
      <p>from government officials and others and the focus on the on the debt ceiling um I gave a speech at USC last week and I said all this talk about the debt ceiling is like sitting on the Santa Monica Pier and you've got a 30-foot wave coming in and you're worried about the Santa Monica Pier being damaged um but you know 10 miles out is a 200 foot tsunami um and that's kind of the situation here and to some extent it's it's discouraging that the Republicans have given the Biden Administration the debt ceiling to even talk about because it enables them to talk about a responsibility and the real problem is not the debt ceiling is a market event it wouldn't be it wouldn't be pleasant it would be stupid but the other thing is an existential a threat to American</p>
      <p>capitalism you just mentioned in 2040 that's not that far away folks I mean think back 17 years 2006 doesn't seem that long ago that's that's 2040 and in 2040 um entitlements plus centers expense using CBO estimates which I think are ridiculously low on interest rates if we're in that situation um are greater than that's when they cross become greater than taxes in 2052 just 30 years using their projections it's a taxes it's 117 percent of taxes and we have an 11 deficit assuming a four percent interest rate will give if you have that situation interest rates aren't going to be four so the most annoying thing is probably the Republicans caving in which they probably needed to if they</p>
      <p>want to keep their jobs on the entitlements look Jesse James why do you rob the bank's webs where the money is there's no money except entitlements that's where it is we are absolutely going to cut entitlements in this country it is a lie and it is a fantasy to say we don't have to cut entitlements the problem is we're either going to cut them now or we're going to cut them later but if we cut them later because we will have waited the interest expense which is already set under CBO to go from 8 to 27 percent of GDP will go much much higher um so it's a choice and I don't think it's a hard one because they say how bad it would be for current seniors if we were to do something entitlement well what about future seniors why should current seniors get a dollar or 100 of a loaf and future seniors get zero it makes no sense to me and until we deal with this it's going to squeeze out everything else it's</p>
      <p>going to squeeze out government investment is going to squeeze out private investment uh and is going to have terrible Economic Consequences and it's just extremely disheartening to watch well Washington macaron trying to resolve it and paying he's going through his Harbinger well that's that's macronas that's quite interesting and I learned something when I was doing the uh preparing the speech for USC because I knew we were in bad shape the economists have something they call the fiscal Gap that's the amount you would have to raise taxes today to maintain the generosity that you've promised futures future seniors um and in the United States that's 7.7 of GDP what does that mean that means if you wanted to fix this situation today without touching entitlements you'd have</p>
      <p>to raise taxes 40 tomorrow morning and keep the mayor forever or cut spending tomorrow morning by 35 percent keep the mirror forever although of course it's worse than that um because that would cause the economy to go down and actually tax revenues go down blah blah blah what was astonishing to me is our fiscal Gap is 7.7 percent France France the poster child for social welfare and all that stuff their fiscal Gap is 2.4 percent so it's less than a third of ours and they're addressing the problem it's just it's frankly amazing really it's lack of leadership so this obviously leads us to ask about the dollar which you referred to and the dollar could certainly fall 25 percent to reach equilibrium but there are other factors that could</p>
      <p>make it worse after the freezing of Russian foreign exchange Reserves there's been steady liquidation of barn Central Bank holdings even France has reduced its treasury by 25 since March last year the weaponization of the U.S dollar is having dramatic consequences and now you have the possibility that China could continue to grow while the U.S is in a hard Landing and this this brings me to one of your favorite themes and that's the curse of the reserve currency so please give me your your outlook for the dollar given everything we were talking about and explain what you mean by the curse of the reserve currency well I think most of the audience has heard of the resource course if you have um oil or some great metal onto the ground</p>
      <p>the population doesn't have to work very hard and there's not a lot of innovation um going on so the economy never really innovates and grows dramatically and does the right thing the the best um probably way to explain the resource course is to take the opposite and that's Israel they have no resources they've dramatically outperformed the rest of the Middle East who has all the resources um the reserve currency is an unbelievable privilege and unfortunately that privilege while you have it allows you if you choose to do so to run very myopic policies that don't address the long-term and allows you to behave in a way because markets don't check you because you're being funded by outside sources</p>
      <p>everything we just described um the fiscal recklessness the monetary recklessness all that no other country could have pulled that off and it's fun and it's great while it lasts but it enables you to keep digging and digging and digging into a deeper hole until [Music] um the consequences come to bear and ironically it probably to some extent you do it enough you lose the privilege and then you only have the consequences so that's why I call it the curse of the reserve currency when Britain um tried to do fiscal stimulus with with mistrust um the market immediately shut them down and they immediately went to a more responsible form of government we have no check on us well all this craziness</p>
      <p>we just talked about went on in 21 and 22 the dollar actually went up any other place the market would have rejected it and we would have gotten our house in order immediately when you're the reserve currency you can continue digging your own grave until filing your debt and you're under the soil the things that disturb me the last decade was what I would call the trying to solve the problem of death with Florida of course that was done in the 20s very unsuccessful and with free money there was a massive misallocation of resources and I was very worried when I saw the pricing of borrowing or risky Borrowers at ridiculously no rights that did not reflect risk</p>
      <p>and adding going back to your comment about no bankruptcies sooner or later this this has to be resolved and how do you think it is going to be resolved will the government end up supporting everything is there a limit you know whether it be winners and losers well Donna survive and some won't how do you think that that ends I don't know that is the existential question of our time um if we get in a hard Landing our we finally going to allow creative destruction and capitalism to do its thing with horrible near-term when I say near-term one to three year consequences [Music] um I think if we do we'll have a chance people will go back to work values will come back even gen Z will think maybe</p>
      <p>they're supposed to work um maybe we can clean all this out and what's made America great for 200 years could possibly revive on the other hand we can go the route we've been going for the last 20 or 30 years which is try more monetary stimulus more debt sort of what Japan has done and end up in a permanent malaise we're not nearly we don't have the Firepower we had back then but I will never forget because it was right after I started Duquesne 1982. volcker intentionally threw us into a recession he raised rates to 20 percent we had a horrible recession um in 82. big increase in unemployment but you know what even politically Reagan won 49 states in 1984. we got 20 to 30 years of</p>
      <p>prosperios we took the pain and we cleaned up our Act I'd never bet and say America is finished and I would like to try that I hope they try that experiment again which is not manipulate things but you know given given our political history given the divisiveness given Where We Are it's it's hard to imagine any politician having the guts guts to do that going forward and then into your earlier question if a Federal Reserve chairman tries it um particularly given the record of the last four or five years their independence could be threatened so it's um we're in a precarious moment I what came to mind as you were talking is Andrew melon's famous statement from the early 30s liquidate labor liquidate Capital urge</p>
      <p>The Rock from the system and of course he was vilified for that the way things unfolded and do we have the courage to follow through he was vilified and God and depression would be a horrible price to pay um but again and I don't want a depression and I hope we don't do policies to throw you in our depression but it is funny to look back America kind of did okay after the 30s ended um and so they're they're going to be tough choices ahead and I think we all have to be open-minded and watch and and see how they go we don't even know who the president's coming in 2024 hopefully it's not going to be Donald Trump or Joe Biden all right you suggested that there's a good chance that the coming decade could be a lost decade</p>
      <p>for for Equity markets and again you know we're dealing in scenarios and building possibilities but you've obviously gotten through in such a situation how can we protect our wealth yeah just because I said I expected the market to be flat same place it was in 10 years doesn't mean it'll be a lost decade for investors you could have made a lot of money um in the 68 to 82 period being long the stock market and being long the right stocks at the right time we had huge bull market rallies from 70 to 72 as you mentioned earlier you could have made a fortune in oil chemical those kind of stocks early on then we had another huge rally obviously from 75 up to the 77 period so even if we were</p>
      <p>flat for the next 10 years there'll be opportunities I have no doubt unfortunately I'm not smart enough to identify them but I have no doubt there will be applications made on top of the model builders in AI where you'll have 100 billion dollar companies emerge and who knows with with all the dark talk we've had which is more than I think either of us would have liked to last 40 or 45 minutes um AI could be as impactful productivity wise as the PC was for all the technology we've had so much of it has gone into social networks and other things that have not enhanced productivity um there there are some hopes there but when I look at marketed 20 times earnings when I look at margins as high as they are when I look at the fiscal challenges I just pointed out and the squeezing of private investment um I was asked a question and I answered it it's it's it's hard for me to Envision stocks being higher in 10 years and I</p>
      <p>think it was in response so I kept Washington TV and everybody was embarrassed and said but I'm bullish for the long term I just don't want people to go and buy and hold and and think they're going to make nine percent a year in the next 10 years I've been wrong before they might but that's not that's not my expectation he told me when we spoke a week or so ago that MBs is the most popular leader in the Middle East and the people actually not him I have to confess that it was a surprise to me and what do you think the significance of this is for the Middle East and geopolitics in general well I just think our Administration has made him a terrible mistake isolating the sky um he's 37 years old he's wildly popular not just in Saudi Arabia but in the Middle East he's a he's a dynamic dynamic leader and</p>
      <p>it appears to me and this is more gas analysis he's trying to make himself a hegemony in in the Middle East um I noticed he brought the president of Egypt in met him at the airport done a deal with Iran he's sort of building this autocratic block within the Middle East and I think he's probably going to succeed um so I just think we've made a huge mistake frankly I think his um discouragement is not so much toward the U.S as the Biden Administration and if we get the Right leader I think this can be repaired underlining think um as opposed to know it can be repaired so depending on who the president is in 24 I think we can get this back but I think it's imperative we get this back this guy's going to be in power for 40 or 50</p>
      <p>years obviously we have an energy transition no matter what you think about climate there's a bridge of at least 10 to 15 years and we don't want him to be in bed with China and not in bed with us I just think it's a disaster given the whole geopolitical outlook looking forward well let's uh let's uh move on to happier subjects and some personal questions to finish up here [Music] you and your wife you want to raise three extraordinary daughters despite enormous family well and how did you manage it and what's the advice you have for others because they're not in time but how do you best transfer wealth to the next generation without generating entitlement in the loss of the drive to succeed I managed it</p>
      <p>with ridiculous luck um I married someone who I was in love with and I knew she was very intelligent and had great values but I had no idea what a great mother she would be and um I've always told young people in terms of parenting forget quality time it's quantity time all time with your children is quality time there's no such thing just like you can just do quality it's it's funny because my wife and I had a very different view um in terms of how to how to handle our wealth in the kids um she she didn't say no a whole lot and I thought she was crazy but in terms of the household she was the boss and you're right We've Ended up with three very happy overachieving grounded children I think</p>
      <p>she gave up her job and made her job being that raising the children home and put such effort into it and spent so much time with them I tried to spend the time with him I could and I think rather than preaching to them they just observed our behavior and our values and they ended up being great kids but I'd say I had about three percent to do that and Fiona had 97 to do with it so there was a lot of luck involved but if you're only as happy as your least happy child uh I'm very very lucky there they are well people in our business tend to be very focused and driven but I wouldn't say many of them are happy but you're a happy man you've got this Balanced Life you're one of the great philanthropists in America you have a beautifully evolved spiritual</p>
      <p>wife who you love these three lovely daughters all successful and you have this balance and yet you achieved this phenomenal performance and you're a happy man how do you do it I don't know Carol I've just been very fortunate I've lived the American dream um my mother-in-law says I'm idiots Savannah I agree with her I don't know why I just happen to be good at compounding money I love the business I love the intellectual stimulation of knowing every event in the world changes some security price somewhere and trying to figure out the puzzle so if it works 60 or 70 hours a week and you love your job there's so many hours right there um we don't do we're somewhat anti-social so we don't spend a lot of time doing that stuff which leaves time uh to</p>
      <p>to be with our family and do do Leisure not not associated with going out to dinners and Society events and stuff like that yeah the philanthropy um is just a source of great joy and I consider it a privilege that we have the money to do it I don't think it's something we should be thanked for I I like to say I like to thank the grantees because they're giving us the joy of funding them and they're the do-gooders out there change the world so look given the wife I've lived and living the American dream if I wasn't happy I that would be bizarre to me so I've just had an extremely lucky life yeah it's wonderful to hear stance I need to do it and the last question is your philanthropy obviously you have your fingers in many different pies many different things are going on what are you most excited about and what's most interesting in the space</p>
      <p>well as you know there's a few things but as you know um I had the great Fortune meeting Jeff Canada back in the early 90s and he basically was the father of I would say the the place matters thing that Raj Chetty um subsequently proved with Statistics but that if you can change your neighborhood you can clear out some of these pockets in America where kids don't have a shot at the American dream um because of the success of the Harlem Children's Home and because we have a great leader there now young leader Jeff has actually come back to work after retiring and he's helping roll this out nationally so through blue Meridian partners um and I would say because George Floyd combined with coven kind of shined a light on on the plight of disadvantaged neighborhoods there's just tremendous new interest from new funders in in the place matter space play Space</p>
      <p>models so that's something uh I'm tremendously excited about sort of taking the Harlem children's own model finding leaders in other challenge cities and changing them so economic Mobility the other one um is just cancer I've been on the board of Sloan Kettering Memorial Sloan Kettering for I think 27 or 28 years the first 10 or 15 years we were poisoning people with chemotherapy and hoping it would kill the cancer before it killed then then about 14 years ago they sort of figured it out mutations personalized medicine there just wasn't one lung cancer there were hundreds of them uh immunotherapy basically they cracked the code and the cancer therapies are going like this if you're on an s-curve we're we're cider right right here the lung cancer center we funded there in 2014 the the outcomes of survivals over five years for 14 they're now 58</p>
      <p>and that's sort of just what's going on throughout cancer so that's really really an exciting area to see an area that um we're hoping for the same kind of results but it hasn't happened yet as it is in the neuroscience and neurology place there we funded a lot of basic um basic research and we don't have the results of the cancer I'm hoping we're 10 or 15 years behind it but I do think the brain will sort of Be the Last Frontier and you only get Success Through failures and we're finding out over and over again what doesn't work but I'm pretty sure they'll figure it out and then the last thing is the is the environment uh that that's a big bucket for us and um there's a lot of money going into uh climate uh and other things I would I would just say there I've been very disappointed that it's sort of a top-down command and control model and</p>
      <p>why we're not doing a carbon tax and forgetting all this government intervention and just letting the market handle it it's been a big disappointment but those are our three big buckets are our economic Mobility which obviously really is affected by education um to health and then through the environment that's very inspirational when you continue to do so many good things with so many people I'm very grateful for having healthy and happy and change and good work well I think that wraps it up for today and thank you so much for Carol it's always great to see you I I love talking to you but your questions are a little too hard but uh it makes it more fun in some ways [Music] thanks for thank you thanks a lot have a good day you too</p>

      <div class="transcript-body">
      <p>Stan we have been um discussing in Oslo inflation energy AI chips geopolitics and so on so when you put your investing hat on what's at the top of your mind the top of my mind first of all it's good to see you Nikolai the the I would guess the top of my mind is just how uncertain for me trying to analyze the environment is going forward I've been doing this for 45 years I've studied a lot of economic history but I've never had a situation where you had free money for 11 years a very broad asset bubble followed by jacking up rates 500 basis points in 12 months so for someone like me who likes to look at history and come up with potential scenarios this is a particularly difficult period</p>
      <p>two years ago wasn't so difficult when you had two years at 15 basis points and money's probably growing at 30. it didn't take a genius to figure out that was a good risk reward um these days things are a lot more complicated but you just mentioned about everything on our mind the generative AI inflation is on our mind acid bubbles currencies all the stuff we usually think about so how do you navigate it then uh well luckily I don't have any clients so I don't have uh I don't well you see I have I have one client and it's pretty big it's really big um I don't have to I don't feel performance pressure um so historically I deal in five or six</p>
      <p>asset buckets tends to keep me out of trouble in terms of playing in an area where I shouldn't be playing at a particular time and I think it's one of the most important things to do is not to play when you when you don't see a fat pitch I don't see a fat pitch in fixing comes extremely complicated because I'm I'm in the hard Landing camp um probably sometime later this year but again this is so complicated I'm not willing to place a big bed and even if I believe in a hard Landing which I do what do you do with two-year treasuries and a sub four percent with funds at five and a quarter I better be right of my hard Landing if I want to own fixed income and then in the long run um historically this is easy if I</p>
      <p>believe we're hard Landing I'm supposed to own bonds but they're not exactly a screaming bargain 10 years at three and a half in in the U.S particularly with a Fed that has certainly shown some metal in the last year but historically I wouldn't say Jerome Powell is a profiling courage so if we get into hard landing and he moves aggressively I could see bonds and inflation coming back with a Vigor from what I expect to be a lower level than right now I will say that the the response to Silicon Valley a nerve May a little because in four days they print enough money they basically wiped out the entire reduction of the balance sheet they had done for five or six months so if I'm trying to look ahead and anticipate I don't have a lot of faith in these guys should we get into a hard Landing</p>
      <p>that they're going to hold the line and not do something maybe worse than Arthur Burns and and where does it leave equities I think within the equity Market if if put a gun in my head I'd be sure the economy to the extent I should something pure like Russell 2000 obviously I don't want to go into individual short names but names um like that old economy economically sensitive stuff but let's just say we're gonna have a hard landing and a bad recession in the U.S what does that mean for NVIDIA I don't know I mean oils and and chemicals went up in 73 and 74. Staples have gone up in bad recessions in the U.S historically what do I do if with a company if you have a bad recession in the U.S but it's</p>
      <p>growing wildly throughout that period because we have an arms rates going on in its space it's not clear to me it goes down so I think the equities are complicated I mean I'd say the one area that whether I I feel reasonably comfortable in is I'm sure the United States dollar currency Trends tend to run at least two or three years we had a long one here over 10 trillion something like 13 trillion came into the US dollar during the previous decade I will say full disclosure I missed the dollar probably the biggest Miss in my career and in currency trades I missed the last nine months run up in the dollar I just couldn't bring myself down Joe Biden and Jerome Powell but um on a relative basis the tightening in the U.S going forward</p>
      <p>will not be as much as as the foreigners now that we've weaponized the dollar and you've got people like Google uh running around asking why we need to be trading in US Dollars by the way it's not a bad question historically we could be trusted we had a rule of law a lot of things so about the only space I have any risk on right now it's it's in the US dollar um don't run out in short dogs I could change my mind in a week but that's where I am right now and I'm also on gold obviously for the same reasons but just uh just to come back to this so you say you haven't seen it as problematic for 45 years and it's really complicated and so on so what do you do then you're sitting cash or no I'm too I'd like to I'd like to say I had I'm still in cash but I'm too much of a junkie I'm always doing something I I'd say uh our equities were about</p>
      <p>three percent net short which is nothing but again I've got there's always equities we like versus other equities our fixed income position is minimal except in jgbs where I don't know whether I'm getting it paid or not but I think the risk reward is is ridiculous it reminds me a little just a little of the two-year two years ago they have an inflation problem but again I'm dealing on government action so it's not cash we got stuff going on but uh I'd say my p l doesn't move generally more than 30 or 40 basis points a day that's how button down I have what I'll call our Matrix here our Matrix being the buckets I talked about and the investment within those buckets yeah well you'd be pleased to hear that I'm I'm joined by roughly 200 junkies here in Oslo uh who also think it's difficult to not do much now</p>
      <p>tomorrow we're releasing a podcast with Steven Schwartzman from Blackstone and he has one of his 25 rules not to lose money and so I mentioned him I said isn't that a bit of a lame advice it's a bit obvious but you are kind of in the same camp aren't you I mean I think you never had a down year and you are a pretty uh super keen on not losing money why is that so important I mean again again it's a lame question right but it's actually not that lame but uh let's listen to you it's just mathematics um if you go down 50 you got to go back 100 to get it back to even and I've always thought the way to build a long-term track record is when you really see the ball swing really big and when you don't see the ball don't swing and if you can build a record and when you're terrible years you're up zero to five and then throw a couple 50s and 60s</p>
      <p>in the numbers look pretty good over time if you make if you make a bunch of uh 30s and then you lose 55 or 60 percent you got a long long way back and it's just the way the numbers worked then also I'm a sore loser I don't like to lose so that kind of helps out too just remind us of your compounding well when I had clients which is the only audited record it was uh just a little bit over 30 percent net a year for 30 years yeah well that's that's that's pretty good but again the top here was 99.99 I had a lot of uh I had a lot of five and sevens in there I didn't like like 20 30 every year it was a matter of never losing and then throwing some big numbers in there maybe 10 times</p>
      <p>yeah well that sounds like a plan for the fun here as well um now um [Laughter] um tell us how do you um uh when you invest how important is the analysis and how much is now gut feel or pattern recognition yeah um I don't know who but I heard a saying with analysis comes paralysis and uh or Soros used to say invest and then investigate which I was already doing before I met him but uh it's more important now even than it was then we're in such a fast-moving world with all the new Communications that if I get an idea and I think it's attractive and for whatever reason that security price will be higher in a year or two um I generally go ahead and buy it and then tell the analysts to book into it</p>
      <p>and if it turns out I was wrong after they analyze it I get out I I don't like to wait around I've a lot of my best ideas I'm not that smart so if I if I see it whatever's going on to cause that idea to happen someone else might see it and by the time we get done analyzing I will miss 30 or 40 of the move and then I'm paralyzed because it just went up 30 or 40 percent and I don't have the guts to buy it even if I think it's going higher we're more in the camp of if if we got a strong feeling we'll cut the analysis short and then then by all means do our analysis thoroughly and then just unload it if it turned out my my thesis was wrong do you depend more on on this type of pattern recognition than you did in your early days no I I started in the 70s and my mentor</p>
      <p>turned out to be a chartist um I still use that a to find to find things others may not be looking at because we use rate of change stuff that tends to lead and B it's if I do take a big position it's a great check on me not falling in love with security or falling in love with my idea to have those to have those charts as part of this discipline he used to say um if there's six thousand uh well I don't know whether politically correct would say if there's six thousand girls out there you can date you can always find 20 that have a good chart and a good fundamental story so if either if either one didn't fit um I wouldn't do it so that the technical provides a discipline on the fundamental and the fundamental divide provides a discipline on the technical</p>
      <p>now I believe um that one of the Hallmarks of a great investor is to have to be stubborn but at the same time agile and being able to change your mind then you have that incredible combination now how do you question your own beliefs price action is important I try to have young people around me who are not afraid to speak their mind to me and argue with me uh if somebody's here too long and they agree with everything I say they're not here that much longer because you know I need healthy debate but you know we're constantly following the news we're following the fundamentals and also the price action I will say since the Algos and everybody got involved in Factor investing and whatever's going on these days um price action is not what it used to be 20 or 30 years ago 20 30 years ago if a company reported a horrible result</p>
      <p>and it opened down say 10 and ended up on the day you could almost guarantee that stock was going to be higher in three months it's not the case anymore everybody seems to know these tricks I've seen that action and then a month later this the Stock's right back down again so part a big part of my process which is price action versus news I obviously still watch it if I've got a thesis and it's really bullish and it's playing out and the Stock's not going anywhere makes me go back and check the thesis over and over but price action versus news is not is not what it used to be 20 or 30 years ago probably because the competition has learned the same game whereas when I got in the business you didn't have that many people that had it that bigger part of their process so you set the passive passive Capital going into the ETFs or is it actually the you know the AI algo Traders and so on</p>
      <p>I don't think it's so much the passive I think it's very active hedge funds that learned the the same stuff doing it and obviously these these Factor investors and Algos and quants definitely they they'll really mess up um what used to be historical price action versus news and its message a lot of people in my position have complained about them I you know to me it's just a new world and I got to deal with people got to deal with me I might as well have to deal with them very good so um lastly Stan if you were to leave us with some good advice here how are we going to make the most money for the next two years oh boys um you know I I said something that the Press ran with I don't know eight months ago maybe it was a year ago that um</p>
      <p>I would be I wouldn't be surprised if if the stock market was not higher in 10 years I still believe that but I do think like the 68 to um 82 period will have some big swings so I think the way to make money the next two years in the equity space is to be patient because I I do think we have possibly some rough roads ahead and I do think the central bank will respond in some crazy way that will give you a period like 70 to 72 where you can make money or 76 to 78 when you could have made a lot of money and also for me at least uh I think the currency markets are very interesting but I think this is a movie I've I've never seen anything like it so I'm I'm going to be very careful not</p>
      <p>to dig myself in a hole when I don't have a strong belief to come out because I think the opportunities are going to be amazing as this movie unfolds in the next year in macro and inequities great I think that's a fantastic um place to end it ties in what we heard here today that the world is changing we've never seen it before it's um a shift it's a paradigm shift uh we're going kind of through a new door we are in a bit of a vacuum so uh big thanks for sharing your thoughts with us today thank you [Applause]</p>

      <div class="transcript-body">
      <p>YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS AND WHAT YOU SAY ABOUT THE CRISIS IN THE MARKETS AND LET'S GO BACK TO WHAT WE HEARD IN OCTOBER WHEN WE SPOKE AT A CONFERENCE AND SAID THAT YOU WERE SHORTING U.S. TREASURYS AND I THINK IT WAS 10% TO 15% OF YOUR PORTFOLIO AT THAT TIME AND YOU ARE STILL SHORTING TREASURYS BASED ON WHAT YOU'RE WATCHING? >> I STILL HAVE SHORTENED TREASURIES, AND I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SURPRISED BY INTEREST RATES RISING AFTER THE CUT AND OF COURSE, WE WEREN'T BECAUSE I THOUGHT THE FED WAS MAKING A MISTAKE, AND I WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE SAME ANIMAL SPIRITS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AND OF COURSE, OUR HORRENDOUS FISCAL SITUATION. HAVING SAID THAT, WE'VE COME QUITE A WAYS AND WE'RE PROBABLY IN THE 7th INNING AND YOU CAN MAKE A LOT OF MONEY FROM THE SEVENTH INNING AND WHO KNOWS? IF THE FED'S STIMULUS WITH THE KIND OF ANIMAL SPIRITS I TALKED ABOUT WOULD GIVE YOU UPWARD INFLATION WHICH IS NOT OUR FORECAST, BUT WE'RE DEFINITELY OPEN MINDED TO IT AND WE'RE NOT</p>
      <p>EXPECTING LOWER INFLATION AND THAT COULD TIP THE BOND MARKET AND CREATE A PROBLEM. SO WE ARE STILL SHORT TREASURYS, BUT WE'RE CERTAINLY NOT PRESSING THE SIZE OF THAT POSITION NOW. >> YOU SAID IN A PERFECT WORLD, STAN, THAT YOU'RE NOT A FAN OF TARIFFS, BUT THAT IT COULD BE POTENTIALLY THE LESSER EVIL IF IT'S DONE IN MODERATION. >> YEAH. I DON'T WANT TO EXIT THIS INTERVIEW AS TARIFF MAN [ LAUGHTER ] >> IN A PERFECT WORLD I WOULD NOT BE FOR A 10% TARIFF, BUT WE'RE NOT IN A PERFECT WORLD. AS YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A BIG FISCAL PROBLEM, MANDATORY SPENDING PLUS INTEREST EXPENSES, LITERALLY 100% OF REVENUES RIGHT NOW, AND BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE HAVE SAID THEY ARE NOT ABOUT TO CUT ENTITLEMENTS WHICH IS THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM. HAVING SAID THAT, BECAUSE OF THAT, WE NEED PAY FORCE. SO OUR MAIN CHOICES ARE AN</p>
      <p>INCOME TAX AND A CONSUMPTION TAX LIKE TARIFF. SO WHEN I SAY TARIFFS ARE THE LESSER OF THE TWO EVILS IN TERMS OF THOSE TWO, BECAUSE THEY HAVE A FISCAL PROBLEM, WE NEED REVENUES. TARIFFS WILL GENERATE REVENUES. WE ALSO HAVE A PRIVATE SAVINGS IN THIS COUNTRY, THEY'RE FAR TOO LOW. I THINK THEY'LL BE FINE WITH A CONSUMPTION TAX. TO ME, TARIFFS ARE SIMPLY A CONSUMPTION TAX THAT FOREIGNERS PAY FOR SOME OF IT. THE RISK IS RETALIATION, BUT AS LONG AS WE STAY IN THE 10% RANGE, AND I THINK SO-CALLED FEAR OF DONALD TRUMP, I THINK -- I THINK THE RISK IS OVERBLOWN RELATIVE TO THE REWARDS. THE REWARDS ARE HIGH AND IT'S MORE OF THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS. >> YOU KNOW, STAN, YOU HAD SAID BEFORE THE ELECTION THAT YOU WOULD NOT BE VOTING FOR KAMALA HARRIS. YOU WOULD NOT BE VOTING FOR DONALD TRUMP.</p>
      <p>PART OF YOUR CONCERN WAS, I THINK WHAT YOU CALLED BIPARTISAN FISCAL RECKLESSNESS ON THE PART OF ALL PARTIES AT THIS POINT. YOU'VE BEEN VERY CONCERNED ABOUT OUR SPENDING LEVELS AND NOT GETTING THAT UNDER CONTROL, BUT SCOTT BESSENT HAS BEEN TAPPED TO BE THE INCOMING TREASURY SECRETARY. HE'S SOMEONE YOU KNOW WELL. YOU WORKED WITH HIM AND HE WORKED WITH YOU AT THE SOROS FUND AND YOU WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH HIM. I THINK YOU KNOW HIM WELL. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE APPOINTMENTS BEING NAMED WHEN IT COMES TO LOOKING AFTER THE FISCAL SIDE OF THINGS AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT AND WHAT YOU MIGHTSI, OR AT LEAST WHEN IT COMES TO THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT. WHAT YOU MIGHT ANTICIPATE. >> SCOTT'S EXTREMELY CAPABLE. BIG BRAIN, VERY THOUGHTFUL, HE'S IN THE UNIQUE POSITION THAT I DON'T THINK ANY OTHER TREASURY SECRETARY HAS BEEN IN WHERE HE'S BEEN AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN MARKETS. I'M HEARING HE'S BEEN TO 40</p>
      <p>COUNTRIES. I KNOW HE'S BEEN INVOLVED IN MARKETS IN AT LEAST 40 SO HE'S EXTREMELY CAPABLE. HE UNDERSTANDS HIS FISCAL SITUATION. I THINK HE UNDERSTANDS THAT THE BIGGEST RISK TO THIS ADMINISTRATION IS BOTH FISCAL AND INFLATION. HAVING SAID THAT, HE'S NOT IN CHARGE. HE'S EXTREMELY PERSUASIVE. HE HAD NO PROBLEM E ING ME MANY TIMES WHEN WE WORKED TOGETHER, BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW IT'S GOING TO WORK OUT. THIS IS A HUGE, HUGE PROBLEM HE INHERITS. THE DEFICIT IS CURRENTLY AT 6.7% OF GDP. IT'S $1.9 TRILLION. THE LAST TIME WE WERE AT FULL EMPLOYMENT WAS 2017, IT WAS 3.4% WE ALSO HAVE PEACE, SO WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IN THE CAMPAIGN SAID HE'S GOING TO NOT HAVE TAXES ON TIPS, NOT HAVE TAXES ON SOCIAL SECURITY. SO THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON. THERE'S SOME HOPE ON DOJ.</p>
      <p>I'VE HEARD THE OPTIMISTIC ASSESSMENTS. I HOPE THEY'RE TRUE. I'M TOO OLD AND TOO CYNICAL TO REALLY SEE A LOT OF THAT STUFF HAPPENING. IF THEY COULD CUT $200 OR $300 TRILLION OUT, THAT WOULD BE GREAT. IF WE COULD GET SAY, $1 TRILLION OR MORE OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS OUT OF TARIFFS, THAT WOULD HELP. BUT WE'RE JUST IN A MESS, BECAUSE INTEREST EXPENSE IS JUST A HUGE, HUGE GROWING ELEPHANT AND IT'S ABOUT DEFENSE</p>

      <h2>14. Stanley Druckenmiller on Economy, Stocks, Bonds, Trump, Fed: Full Interview</h2>
      <p class="source-link"><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kH01CNISeQ" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kH01CNISeQ</a></p>
      <div class="transcript-body">
      <p>people may be confused they know Stan Druckenmiller or at least they think of Stan Druckenmiller as a hawk you've been complaining for several years that the fed wasn't raising rates fast enough or soon enough and now just as the economy is about to have its best year since 2005 you want the Fed to stop why excellent question and I certainly think it's a valid one let's go back in time a little bit the reason I started I think you would use the word complaining four or five years ago was I became very concerned particularly when they started QE 3 that we hadn't learned our lessons from the past and we were going to create another yet another bubble in financial assets which would lead to yet another bust which would lead to even</p>
      <p>more radical monetary policy and less tip less discipline in terms of government spending and so forth and so on it's almost a repeat of my schizophrenia that went on in the early 2000s you didn't know me Eric but at the time I was a vocal critic of the last fed cut in oh three I became particularly incensed in late oh three when the economy had fairly clearly turned and was growing rapidly that they stuck a considerable period on there to ensure that we'd have escape velocity and good economic growth the only thing they ensured was a housing bubble which then led to what we know became known as a financial crisis now here's the contradictory part</p>
      <p>if you knew me at the time you would also know that I became very vocal in as early as oh five about the housing bubble and by early oh seven was very vocal about how the Fed should be cutting rates and reversing monetary policy I still believe could be wrong we'll never know counterfactuals don't seem to work had Bernanke recognized what was going on when to be fair twenty to fifty money managers did in early to mid oh seven that this was not a little hundred billion dollar problem that was containable but that it was a disaster looming and had he cut six to nine months earlier we would have had a recession but I don't know whether we've had a financial crisis and we certainly would not have had the consequences we've had so let's fast forward as you know a few years ago I started saying if</p>
      <p>you wanted to create a deflationary bust I would do exactly what the Fed was doing since 2010 corporate non-financial debt has grown from six trillion to nine point six trillion where I'm from that's about a 60% increase during that time corporate earnings increased 27% so how in the world did the S&P earnings increased 60% it's because all that borrowed money went to finance buybacks and M&A so this entire trillions and trillions of dollars though to my mind were pushed were as a result of investors being pushed by the Fed to go out on the risk curve take more risk resulted in a big debt built up resulted in Donald Trump feeling comfortable</p>
      <p>doing more fiscal spending resulted in Barack Obama saying he didn't want to he did not want to balance the budget on the backs of old people so there were no entitlement cuts so essentially the bond market which would traditionally have been a vigilante from all this sort of behavior market signals were cancelled we developed yet another bubble and we're now sort of in the position potentially and I want to say potentially where we were in early oh seven but I'm not calling for a cut and that's why I say potentially if you look at the coincident economic indicators which I wish the Fed did they actually look at lagging indicators but if you look at the coincident ones they all look quite good GDP has a three handle so forth and so on if you look at the indicators I have historically used in my business they're</p>
      <p>not quite read yet but they are definitely I'm sorry no continue they're not read yet but what what they are definitely amber and they are setting off warning signs what do you see okay so the best economists I know is the inside of the stock market and I'm sure you've heard Herrick to joke and I heard at Bowden in my economics one class the stock markets predicted nine out of the last five or sessions I will say with all humility that's better than the Fed they've gone over nine so nine out of five it's not it's not that terrible but the best economists I know out there is the inside of the stock market so the Fed when they look at the stock market and they look at financial indicators probably is just looking at the S&P but the decline in the S&P which is funny when I was preparing for this interview it was ten it's now 13 is a bit of Mirage because if you look</p>
      <p>inside the stock market these cyclical elements of the economy particularly the front end sickles have show a completely different picture than the defensive parts of the stuff that's more sensitive to the economy economy so auto stocks are down 30% they're not down 10 or 11 they're down 30 building stocks are down 35 banks which you would think might be a symbol of credit or something else are down 25% the Russell 2000 is down over 20 percent retail equities are down over 20 percent so how in the world could the S&P only be down 10 or 11 when I was looking at these numbers it's because utilities staples and pharmaceuticals which are economically defensive are actually up and this is the same situation I use cycle after cycle so that's one of the thing the inside of</p>
      <p>the stock market which is the best economists I know and which I've used every cycle when I've invested is saying there's something not right here and this is the same set of indicators that you've used to predict the past four recessions the very same yes you might say it's because I have a not-so-pleasant personality but at at duquesne we always made we did predict the last four recessions and our returns going into them and as they started we're always well above our average returns over time so inside the stock market is one indicator the segment would be the yield curve again amber not red but we've inverted as you know from fives and to is just slightly two years of 269 five years at 268 the ten years to 85 so there's not only a big flattening going on it's a very</p>
      <p>confusing bull flattening because it's not like we're looking at high rates to start with here and the Fed is you know told us that there's going to be three to four hikes next year after this hike and the market is just saying no no no then the other thing we've looked at historically is credit tends to lead the economy there seems to be a confidence that this cycle we don't have the danger we had in the last cycle because the bad stuff all our housing back then has not infected the banks it was more done in the high-yield loan market and to me it's true it's great that it's not in the banks because that would probably be a systemic problem at a financial crisis but the economy doesn't really care whether credit is in the banks or it's in the investment community with high a loans in fact I would argue that if you're on the other side of it you much rather work your</p>
      <p>loan out with a bank then you would with some hedge fund manager out there so the fact that I'm sure you read the article in The Financial Times yesterday and the fact that credit is drying up to the extent that it is and there all sorts of warning signs there I think the GE CD s has gone from 50 basis points to 200 basis points since September first iBM has gone from 30 to 80 high yield indexes are moving leverage loans are down 3% but more importantly because we've had eight years of free money and the kind of excesses and pushing people out in the yield curve so that's created it's just a time for caution that you want this bubble to unlined slowly now because if you don't and let's say these indicators turn red you may have to do a lot more crazy monetary stuff and actually it'll be more of a problem in terms of someone like me who eventually</p>
      <p>wants to normalize one study leverage that's the Train I've been on I understand but this isn't an effort to let that bubble out slowly someone I believe used the term three or four years ago that this is a beautiful deleveraging taking place I have no idea what he was talking about how do you have a beautiful deleveraging with us debt going through the roof at the government level and corporate non financial debt growing at the rate it was so what I'm asking for now is not a cut just to take stock of everything I've said and wait and see what happens and what I'd really like to think my business as you know is risk reward so let's just talk about the risk reward here let's suppose I'm completely wrong and three to four months from now none of this stuff matter and all the financial people were crazy and they were panicking because of some technical factor in the market and let's suppose</p>
      <p>the Fed did not hike tomorrow what is the cost okay I'm not sure what the cost is but there's got to be some cost to their credibility two to three months down the road when they start hiking again not a big cost in my opinion let's suppose that these economic indicators the stuff we're looking at the forward-looking stuff is right and we have big potential problems brewing and that they could be even bigger than we think because there's stuff hiding out there we don't know about in terms of malinvestment think about the cost if they hike tomorrow and if they continue to shrink their balance sheet 50 billion a month right when the ECB is not offsetting it I mean that that cost to me is five to ten X you really believe</p>
      <p>that that three-month period makes isn't enough of a difference in other words by hiking on Wednesday presuming that's what they're going to do or hiking now in December instead of hiking in March it's I think it's important that that I understand how you're thinking is it because these that in and of itself could turn those flashing amber signals to red well the hikes already it's making a dovish hike it's now baked into the market by the way the market doesn't seem to be very impressed with it as we sit here today confidence is a fragile and an important thing I think the market is confused about a Fed that three or four months ago sort of let us know well we're going to continue to hike until something either starts to</p>
      <p>break or financial conditions tighten because they're not sure how far they can go yeah and I remember when I was in my complaining period as you call it every time I'd talk someone the audience would raise their hand and say well what would you do if you were at the Fed because I was complaining they weren't starting and then not going fast enough and I would always say the same thing I said I would sneak one in every time I could under booming financial conditions and hopefully get to 3% and then you're there I don't call hiking rates on top of shrinking your balance sheet 50 billion a month when the SP just went down 13 percent and all the cyclical stocks we talked about are down somewhere between 25 and 40 percent I don't call that sneaking one in when financial conditions permit it the those though who study the Fed and like you and maybe even consider themselves</p>
      <p>economists would argue that 25 basis points isn't enough to make a difference to anything and that if in fact the Fed is making a mistake that mistake was baked in and that whether it's December or March or perhaps even June doesn't make that much of a difference well it seems to be baking in at a very rapid rate doesn't it again it's not even the level it's the rate of change and I think if you look back historically I could be wrong on this we in the US have never hiked into a meltdown like this since Volcker and he had a purpose and he had a goal inflation was 12% and come hell or high water was gonna break it what exactly is what are we solving for here I don't I don't quite get it and I got it three or four months ago but now it looks like the markets are warning and again Eric I'm not suggesting the</p>
      <p>Fed cut I'm really not although who knows where my mindset will be in that six months I'm just talking about not hiking rates and by the way we're sort of hiking rates we're certainly tightening monetary conditions even if we don't hike tomorrow because of the roll-off of the feds baton because the balance sheet now some will say well it's just rolling off they're not selling that's not correct if you have a budget deficit and you need to raise money every month you know that creates government bonds selling every month and it tightens liquidity it's not a surprise I know no one looks at money supply anymore I'm a dinosaur but m-2 growth has gone from about seven and a half percent to four percent over the last couple years it doesn't take a genius to figure out why liquidity is tightening and it's tightening rapidly so just to be clear you want the Fed to pause wait three months perhaps even wait six months and then reevaluate is that right yeah it doesn't even have to be three months what I would really like to Fed to do is get out of the forward</p>
      <p>guidance business completely I don't know what it does other than tie their hands I really believe the Fed would have tightened quicker on the on the upside but if you'll remember at the time they guided after the temper tantrum to a specific schedule of QE rolling off and then they guided that interest rates couldn't raise and of course the economy and and financial conditions were booming but they didn't want to lose credibility so they stuck to that schedule what I would like them to do now and of course they're not going to do it but if I was running the Fed I would say something like we're pausing in terms of interest rates for now we really do we would like to normalize over time but but when you normalize matters and I would say the same thing with the balance sheet our long-term goal is to get the balance sheet down but over the near term and the intermediate term we will be data</p>
      <p>dependent in the way we actually do that you know I grew up in a world where the Fed didn't spoon feeds you every day you just come in and they turns out they've raised rates or they're just tweaking the repo rate or something and we seem to do fine without the spoon feeding you want them to go back to an era of best judgment best judgment and I want them to untie their hands forward guidance tides their hand and to be frank given their record it's kind of embarrassing when you forward guide and then you're stuck with a guidance that is not necessarily appropriate you know you you asked me earlier what indicators am I seeing can I just say that that the Fed one of the things that's really puzzled me the feds mandate as you know is maximize full employment over the longer term and stable inflation stable price stability over the longer term okay think about</p>
      <p>that as a mandate to me the way you achieve those objectives is you do not do it with boom bust cycles and we continue to do these booms bust cycles and one of the reasons is somehow the Fed has confused what we're solving for which is price stability and maximum employment with using employment as an indicator employment is in the lagging indicators so just because you want to maximize employment doesn't mean when the lot that when the unemployment is rate you can't back is you can't back off in fact as you know most recessions were preceded by a very low unemployment rate that's what that's where you do you run out of capacity Stan you know what the cynics are going to say right they might even be saying it now that this has nothing to do with the economy that you as an investor want the Fed to pause because you want a Powell put or worse some of those might people might say that you're just giving covered of President Trump okay on the</p>
      <p>power put I just told you I have a demented personality and I've been able to make more money in bear markets and bull markets so I have struggled as I've said in some other interviews which I know you're aware of since we went into the QE business and suppressed all this volatility so at least going forward this is the in kind of environment where historically if they continue to ignore to ignore the kind of signals I'm talking about what profile food for one and I do want to I do want to address Trump because I know there's a narrative out there that the fed will lose credibility if they cave into it if they cave in the Trump here oh look I could not agree more that it would be horrific if the Fed were to pause because they were bullied by Donald Trump I also want to say that it would be horrific if the Fed didn't pause because they were</p>
      <p>afraid people would think they were being bullied by Donald Trump that would be just as political as the first outcome let me just say right I know I'm right let me just say that a stop clock is Right twice a day Donald Trump is a permanently a low interest rate guy we know that's because he's from the real estate industry but just because Donald Trump thinks the dovish tilt relative where we've been as appropriate now doesn't mean it's actually not a good idea right now if the only reason you're not going to pause is because Donald Trump is bullying you you're being just as political if that's the reason you did so we need to just take him out of the equation but poor jpowel can't tell that story either way I've through houses he can't say whether it was or wasn't because the president asked for it and if he doesn't pause similarly he can't say I I feel terrible for j-pal I really do and it goes beyond that his predecessors</p>
      <p>have done him no favors Jani Ellen said she was going to hike 4 times in 2016 and she did not hike until after Trump's election this QE 3 and I said it at the time is now a noose around his neck as they try and unwind this balance sheet he has a very very tough road here in you're right Trump it's making a lot more difficult than he should just shut up do you have any more confidence in this fed board with the appointees that it has many of which were made by the president any more confidence than you did in the Fed governors who were appointed by a President Obama the answer is I don't know it's too early as they just said they've been built a very tough hand I love sort of the humility and the common sense chairman Powell has shown in his press</p>
      <p>conferences I like his style but you know to me what's that lying cane shoes what do you do when there when effects change I changed my mind sir look I know why they guided in September to hike in December the SP was exploding up or an oil was $85 a barrel the reasons they got it in December have all changed okay we can't now go in December just because we say it's going to keep our credibility to me you build your credibility by being data dependent and even the economic data okay I understand the coincidence stuff is strong but some of this leading stuff like autos and housing being this week with 2% rates has got to give them pause that maybe there's something to malinvestment and debt build up and all that weighing down on the economy given what you know about some of these decision makers about jpowel about randy quarrels about rich clara de do you have any confidence that they will be more respectful of</p>
      <p>financial markets perhaps than you think previous fed boards have been um again I don't know I'm waiting with bated breath and I'm going to watch Stan you said that you've said it today you've said in the past that most of the really big money that you made at Duquesne was because of central bank mistakes and the consequent impact on market liquidity correct so why issue this warning why not let the Fed make a mistake if that's in fact what it's going to do position yourself accordingly sit back and make money by the boatload money isn't everything I'm a very competitive person I competed for 30 years I retired seven or eight years ago I kind of feel</p>
      <p>obligated at this point when I see others particularly academic types leading them down what I think is the wrong path let's not forget I'm an American I've been lucky enough to be born in this country to make a lot of money making a lot of money because we're going into another financial crisis and I'm not saying you are but that's the scenario you're laying out I don't see how that would really upgrade my life to see the rest of the country being miserable when I make another you know another killing but that has happened in the past yes and I don't I don't feel guilty about it that was my job it's what I did you had clients I had clients and and to be frank I warned at iris own about the housing bubble in O five with a year and a half lead time and I also met with the Treasury secretary and o-5 and laid out</p>
      <p>the whole thing and not so long ago in 2015 you predicted that the combination of zero rates and quantitative easing which at the time you termed reckless monetary policy that was pushing everybody out on the risk curve would end badly yes and now I'm fearful and I'm not predicting a recession but there's enough stuff out there that I'm worried about a recession and I think it's time for caution well now that we're three years later it's late 2018 with that much for further along into the cycle and there's that much more debt does the end look worse so not what I expected and we haven't ended yet a lot of it is going to be on a whether this stuff continues and B how policymakers and I don't just mean the</p>
      <p>Fed respond to it as it unfolds there was a gentleman on I know he was on a rival Network today mr. Navarro saying the Fed is the whole problem with the markets here okay that is really rich really rich we all know about smoot-hawley we know a way you all know about trade wars and we all know what all this nonsense is doing to business confidence so you know that was something that really wasn't on my radar screen three years ago which was causing or or like initiating trade wars so there's all Sciences stuff going on so I don't know whether it's going to be worse it's going to be possible but I have to see how things evolve is there any way for central banks to withdraw all the liquidity they've pumped into financial markets without</p>
      <p>triggering a bust I think the air can be let out of this balloon without causing another financial crisis I think it's possible but it's hard to believe at least markets will not have struggling returns the next three to five years possible but how difficult oh very difficult which is why I didn't like the so called insurance policy of QE 3 to get escape philosophy in the first place so possible difficult and with poor returns how poor oh I I could see the SP returning between 0 and 5 percent annually the next five years but</p>
      <p>Eric did one of the strengths of my investment returns over time was being open minded and you know I'm just throwing out answers to something that as my wife and others will tell you you know he believes something on Monday and two weeks later he changes his mind but well are we in a bear market now well of course we are we've been on a global bear market for about a year now and for those by the way who say there's no correlation between the economy and the stock market I'll just point out that the Dax and the China market peaked in January and I don't know that anybody's seen their economic data lately but I'm not even talking about the insider starting organs I think I think we're in a bear market in the sense that most stocks globally have been going down for nine to ten months I think it's going to be hard to get out</p>
      <p>of this thing in other words let me start over I don't think it's clear-cut to me which a lot of people say that this is a correction in a secular bull market because we had free money for eight or nine years because we had a debt build-up because we I'm sure we had malinvestment this could take three to five years either sideways or a big down with something else but yeah I think I think the highest probability is we struggle going forward and the bottom may be a ways away still maybe or it could be right here and we're just talking about sideways for quite a while I mean I I will say this in terms of the current market we've done a lot of de-risking I went short the market in in</p>
      <p>July because I saw a cutie coming and I lost my but in July in August because I was three months early you can't be you can't think ahead in this market well since that time I'm torn because cutie I think is still set to accelerate the minute the ECB stops I'm talking global T QT which we pointed out in the article peaked October 1st on the other hand we've had a major adjustment in prices hopefully policymakers and I don't just mean central banks are gonna get the message and with this adjustment in prices and with this D risking that's been done by a lot of investors we could certainly have a favorable period ahead of the next 16 months but it's highly dependent on policy not only from the central banks but from the Chinese and the US government's what to you or the logical macro trades of the stage in the cycle</p>
      <p>logical doesn't mean profitable but um I profitable that I it's funny because when we talked about how I've done well in bear markets I'd love to sit here and tell you it's I made it shorting stocks it's always very difficult in a boom in a bear market they don't trade with rhythm you get these vicious rallies you get squeezed out of shorts people play all sorts of games I always made it in Treasuries because Treasury yields will go down dramatically not so easy this time because one of my biggest hit was in two years and in the fall of 2000 they were 604 Fed Funds for six-and-a-half they went down to like one and a half or two now I'm starting with them at 268 but I'm long Treasuries I'm long two years I'm long five years and a long ten years and I have been for a bit I don't like the level but because of everything we've been talking about I like the risk reward and if the Fed</p>
      <p>makes a policy mistake it's not inconceivable to me at all that the two years back to fifty to sixty basis points in a couple years because they're doing all this crazy nonsense again QE you know the the whole gambit rates at zero blah blah blah so even at these yields I like Treasuries within the stock market and I've held this view for several years and it was okay until recently I love the secular growth stocks because in a period of slow muted growth if you can find a 20 to 30 percent grower it's really like a long-term cashflow in some ways it's almost better than a bond that trend got severely interrupted about six months ago the tax cut and the economy going to the</p>
      <p>extent they were created a lot of cyclical companies whose earnings grew at thirty percent and when they were nine times earnings my companies were twenty five or thirty times earnings now they're having the same earnings growth obviously those companies became in favor it's hard for me to see if we don't go in a recession which I don't think we're going to and gross those down to one and a half and the Fed changes how companies let's let's just take these cloud companies which to me look like sort of mobile ten years ago they've got maybe they're in the second inning of a nine inning game as corporate corporate America and corporate everything has to convert to the cloud you're talking about Microsoft and I talk about Microsoft I'm talking about ServiceNow I'm talking about workday these are companies I'm still like I do like them Salesforce that kind of stuff okay they're very high-priced but to me if</p>
      <p>we're going to go to a one one and a half two percent growth rate and interest rates are going to be B'nai and they're worth more in that environment they are in a three and a half percent environment because they're going to grow the same rate either way and you could argue that if we get in a mild recession demand for their product goes up because it's a way to cut costs is obviously trade moving into the cloud for for employment by the way that view worked out beautifully and then was really bad in October I was between twenty and thirty percent short the stock market the entire month of October and managed to lose a percent you think it was mathematically impossible but these names have such data and when you go from nine times sales to seven times sales I even though your earnings aren't missing a beat it's a problem but I look at them now and they're selling for quite a bit less than they were in say September and again I just described to you why I</p>
      <p>think they'll be okay over the longer term what about a stock that's had the crap kicked out of it like GE yeah that's a difficult one that one I just don't know I'll just say this we were not big fans of Mo we made very good money shorting that stock cope looks very impressive on paper mm-hmm I have to believe he was on that board for four or five months I don't think he went in there looking for a job everything tells me he didn't I assume he knows where the bodies are buried but I just don't know but I sure as hell wouldn't be shorting it at seven and a half would I take a pun on it here I don't know not in the kind of environment we're talking about have you bought anything since the beginning of the decline in the last well yeah</p>
      <p>fortunately or unfortunately yes like there's a whole bunch of cloud companies that I had limits in most of them didn't get hit till October I looked like a genius to myself at least until a couple weeks ago and now they've come back down but it's very interesting what's happened in the last three or four weeks if you look at the November low Salesforce was like a hundred and twelve I think it's probably I didn't look today and it was a big days you know I think it's probably 130 now or something workday bottom that 117 I think it's like I don't know 150 could it could be higher I didn't look at the market we're just after the close but all those names are 15 to 20 percent off their November lows whereas if you look at the banks and the cyclical z' they're all way low below they're November lows now it's a little dangerous saying this because these cloud names may have gone down a lot</p>
      <p>more than I think today but but the relative performance they really suffered because of their beta in October in November even though they have these high betas since November at least on a relative basis they've started to show I think rational behavior what about shorts you've never been afraid of macro shorts or single stock shorts yeah I don't really like to talk about individual stock shorts it just creates a lot of controversy I learned my lesson years ago on your network after a Robin Hood conference I talked about IBM and I could have done with all that without all that publicity but there's plenty of shorts and they have tended to be in at least in my in my book centered around the cyclical and the value area for all</p>
      <p>the reasons I've told you and frankly in tech we've been long the disruptors and short the disrupted which has worked beautifully over in two years again has some real hiccups when the markets plunging and the value guys come in and start buying the disrupted companies which are 10 times earnings and selling the 30 times earnings ones but we have not changed that theme we've been short all the financials because to me it was it was very simple why in the world would you buy a group that needs rates to go up to own it because the last time I checked banks our equities and equities don't do well with with rates going up you still short financials I am on the other hand let's say rates go down I assume my cloud names will do much better and I don't want to own something because it's going to go down less than a down market so yeah we're</p>
      <p>short financials I would also say I didn't mention earlier indicators the fact that AIG is down from 65 to 35 and it's the number one what I would call closed on credit fund on the planet and that since January and the banks are down what they are how can you look at that unless you have just no respect whatsoever for the market and not see that's at least a warning light that there's there's a problem out there Blackstone which is a great beautifully run company with a great management that things down 25% in like a month I mean how how can you look at that and not say again credit dependent that it's not sending a warning signal out is it tend to short credit oh I've been short credit for a while but it's easy to short credit for long Treasuries because again if rates are going up I don't want</p>
      <p>to be short credit because their interest rate instrument and if I make money in Treasuries is because the economy fell apart and there'll be a lot of good there'll be a lot of good credit short so five or six percent absolute nominal yields for stuff that normally would be eight or nine an environment like this the risk award is just terrible in credit oil well I don't know other than to say if I were to fed I'd be watching it you'll notice our article this morning how many times inflation was mentioned zero but if you're looking at inflation which they seem to care about not just oil but all the commodity indexes are down dramatically in the last four or five months and it's inconceivable that that doesn't float through how much more do politics play into your investment process in the Trump era a lot and I stink at it I mean I was I learned this</p>
      <p>business to solve economic puzzles and try and think 18 to 24 months ahead when the president can't seem he's so myopic that he thinks like one or two days ahead at the most it's it's very hard and obviously it doesn't take a rocket scientist all yet it was watch for a few days they have a powerful impact on markets and it's tough because economic signals and an economic puzzle solving is something I've done for a long time and I have some confidence in it how all this politics is going to play out I'm not so sure I happen to think the China thing will work itself out because both sides I think desperately want a deal both Trump and XI but I don't know I don't have the kind of confidence in that forecast as the economic stuff that I've been doing for 40 years so it plays a big part but the major part is quite unnerving does it matter if the</p>
      <p>government shuts down I don't think so that's that's a lot of nonsense it already open again I mean it's it's discouraging to see the theater and it's just more the sense one more of the same as a great term for it Stan no one forgets how you and George Soros broke the Bank of England so to speak in 1992 when you bet against the pound is there a brexit trade for you now there is one but I don't know what it is I could see the pound going to 135 if the markets are convinced there's no hard breaks it mm-hmm and we're going to muddle through here and particularly if the Fed starts easing that would be obviously months down the road if ever happen but if the politics back to your earlier question plays out the wrong way and Gerry core Corbin gets in the mix</p>
      <p>you know then you could see a big downside so it's so it could go either way that is just not so binary it's not something I want to play the beauty of the pound trade that you mentioned was a one-way bet it was either going to be flat or we're gonna make fifteen or twenty percent this is not so appealing you can either make 10 percent or lose 10 percent since I can't figure out which it is elsewhere yes if in fact it goes so to speak the wrong way if there's a hard brexit and to your point Jeremy Corbyn becomes a stronger contender to succeed Theresa May as Prime Minister do you think we see the pound testing and perhaps dropping through that post Briggs it vote low of 118 possible I don't know but it's possible I've heard you complain stand on at least two occasions that the market doesn't generate the same kinds of signals that it used to</p>
      <p>what do you mean by that you know I'm not really complaining I'm more whining there's a difference someone said the other day you've been very critical of these eligos and I said well not critical of the algos they just made my life very inconvenient I don't it's not that they're doing anything wrong so what I meant by that Eric is a big part of my process and you've already kind of heard it throughout the interview is taking signals from markets I've always believed markets are smarter than I am they sent out a message and that if I listened to them properly no matter how powerful my thesis if they're screaming something else it's telling me you've got to reevaluate you got to reevaluate and you go back to and Isis all right fine but you got to be open-minded about I don't know maybe six or seven years ago combination of central bank's canceling the signals but</p>
      <p>maybe more importantly the algos coming in with very very sophisticated models based on historical events and maybe stuff they're picking up on the internet about who's shopping or this kind of stuff and also on standard deviation away from price have come up with their own methodology of how to predict price movements and how to behave well I grew up with someone fundamentally like security and they buy it from somebody who fundamentally doesn't like security and somehow the invisible hand spit out a very good answer and it was predictive over time and I also learned that things would change and when the trends started to go up that's when I'm supposed to plow in well the algos machines trading they tend to have different motivations like they're not nearly as momentum oriented and just when the trend may</p>
      <p>look like it's going up it may be just some algo who's got some standard deviation or something going on and it is severely inhibited my ability to read the signals so my first mentor sparrows trellis back in Pittsburgh used to say 100 million Frenchmen can't be wrong and that was his saying that that the the voice of the market was always correct and I you I need to listen to it and it was true if a company was reporting great earnings and everybody loved it and the stock just didn't act well for three or four months almost inevitably something happened that you didn't foresee six months down the road and I'll never forget about two or three years ago Facebook had reported great earnings stock was like 122 opens at 131 after-hours and like three days later its trading at 116 so the analysts come</p>
      <p>in and they're giving this said nothing's wrong it's great it's great I said no kid you're wrong something's gonna come out you just don't know it yet something terrible in the next three or four months anyway year later the stock was like 220 so that didn't mean anything conversely I can remember so many examples when a company would report bad earnings it goes down 5% on huge volume then closes up on the day almost invariably three to six months later that stock was higher doesn't mean anything anymore other than some hedge fund maybe being a wiseguy or somebody's doing something all the time I've seen that and a month later the stocks actually lower so the price signals that I learned how to read and how to listen to are broken they certainly don't work the way they used to I still liked price action versus news but it used to be a very very important part of my process now it's a much diminished part of my process and frankly as me I don't want</p>
      <p>anybody crying but it's made my job much much more difficult and I'm thrilled I got rid of my clients eight years ago are the markets more or less efficient as a result I think the message over eight or nine months is still great and like Here I am telling you what the auto stocks are doing this I just think over a week or two you're getting noise that used to mean something and now it doesn't mean anything so maybe they're maybe they're not efficient and they're noisy over a week or two but they're still pretty darn good predicting predicting ahead I mean the the the classic recent example was the night Trump was elected bonds got murdered you know they they opened up five points in the middle of night ended up down on the day stock market was down like some crazy amount overnight ended up that day you know predict and all the cyclical</p>
      <p>stocks were going back to this they predicted this whole thing by the way and it's only the last year they turned the other way so the market was just laughing at all the pundits the market doesn't laugh but you know what I mean the market was predicting a big economic recovery and an acceleration under Trump whereas all the Talking Heads were saying this was Armageddon in the end of the world and the market was right now the markets kind of going yeah do you find yourself similarly inconvenienced by passives as you do algo zinc wants I don't know the answer to that I'm just you've bought et us yeah I've bought them I'm price action versus news in general I don't want to blame it on passives or an algos or whatever but price action versus news which was a big part of my</p>
      <p>process doesn't work as well as it used to and I'm gonna learn how to do more fundamentals than I have a store clink I presume you're not doing as well as you used to as a result yeah I as you know made 30 percent a year for 30 years we ain't even in the same zip code much less the same state as those kind of returns so stand the reversal of quantitative easing and the return of volatility to financial markets was supposed to be just the elixir that hedge funds needed hasn't worked out that way what do you think well first of all it's early days and if the trends has changed sometimes it takes them a while to adjust secondly I remember everybody always at some point my career saying boy this volatility must be great for you and I said well Italy is only good if it's part of a trend and it's giving you entry points within a trend we're getting volatility particularly with Trump with no trend so when you're</p>
      <p>going up and down but there's no real trend that's a nightmare to our earlier point about price action versus and news you might think something that a volatility move is the beginning of a trend and get yourself whips on so have you ever seen anything like that before like this not to this extreme no no I would also say and I think I predicted this on your network five years ago 9,000 hedge funds charging 20% or what it was this was going to happen anyway I mean when I started Duquesne there were about 8 of us and we were expected to make 20% a year year in and year out no matter what the environment well when you and by the way I was like the only guy at Bowdoin that went into this so the competition wasn't so hot you mean the only person in your graduating class yeah because we've been</p>
      <p>in a bear market for ten years okay by 2000 the average IQ come in this century at least 30 or 40 points higher than mine so you know the markets become more efficient it's become more difficult every time you buy something somebody's selling it to you in and if the competitors have gotten that much smarter it's tougher so I'm not surprised at all by the hedge funds not doing well because well to be frank I kind of predicted at five or six years ago but certainly this environment is aggravating it just no trend and and a lot of volatility yeah well maybe some there was a trend and I think they didn't do that well on the upside because of all the competition and because frankly there wasn't enough volatility for entry and now the</p>
      <p>competition tends to be diminishing but we're in this new crazy highly volatile world does the fundamental discretionary hedge fund managers still have a future as a species yes I think so but you know I think it'll there's probably going to be 10 to 20 of them that are great and the rest of them sure as hell aren't worth 20% a year and they're probably not worth 15% a year there's still 3 trillion dollars of hedge fund money yeah chasing a defined amount of alpha is that too much money yeah I think so yes should be what I don't know less by definition you've been called grumpy yes is that how you think of yourself I like I enjoy being grumpy but no I don't think of myself as</p>
      <p>grumpy at all I have a fabulous family I was born in a great country I have a job that doesn't particularly provide much as a society that has this crazy renew Mauritian associated with it I mean so I'm not sure what the term grumpy means but I'm one of the happier people I know I just I enjoy having a persona that's a little grumpy do you think grumpy is a better disposition to have as an investor uh I think you have to be a little skeptical and a bit of a contrarian but no you don't you definitely don't have to be grumpy and I think Bulls make more money than bears so if anything be an optimist about life and about things in general is a great attribute to have as as an investor you just can't be starry-eyed and not naive well I think better of characteristic</p>
      <p>would be being able to control your emotions but I don't relate that to grumpiness if you think about everything that you've experienced yourself you've seen the things that you think are happening now and the things that you believe are likely to happen in the future what are the qualities or characteristics that a money manager should come to the business with today you're asking really great questions Eric I think the number one neat thing you need is you need to be well there's about three but you need to be intellectually curious and really really open-minded so and you need you need to have courage and when I say courage you need the courage a bit big and a bit concentrated but also the courage to fight your own emotions I've never made a buy at a low that I</p>
      <p>didn't just feel terrible and scared to death making it it's easy to sell at the bottom you know you can go home that night and relieve you of your nerves and then you know the higher they go there's another saying drill issues to have the higher they go the cheaper they look so when things are going up it's easy to buy them when they're going down it's hard to buy them do you need to be able to code do you need to be able to program an algorithm no no but apparently some very good coders and very good algorithms really know how to make money you see so you can do that but it's not a necessary condition to make money as investor I do think in today's world you better know what they're doing because they and particularly if you're in the treating business like I am they influence markets and you have to know if a particular price move is happening because of them or if it's happening for more natural causes</p>

      <p>hi everyone uh thanks for being with us today we um it is a really unique privilege to be hosting one of the world's greatest investors and having the opportunity to gain his insights on risk and trading our guest began his career in markets at the pittsburgh national bank of all places uh and he began in equity research in 1981 he left the bank and started duquesne capital based in pittsburgh and after a few years he left and started his own firm called duquesne capital a few years into running duquesne he was hired by dreyfuss and he only went there on the condition he could continue to run duquesne and then in 1988 he went to george to work for soros working with george soros and running his quantum macro fund while stan was there the fund grew to 20 billion dollars in assets and throughout his time both at soros anna dreyfus he continued to run</p>
      <p>duquesne management here's some facts on duquesne duquesne has never had a losing year and it was founded in 1981. his assets while not disclosed to something greater than 10 billion his annual returns while not disclosed exceeds 25 per annum which by the way in the same period makes him a more successful investor than warren buffett his total staff is less than 100 people including the back office and that's what he uses to generate those returns and for us he is probably the most professional and valued client we have because his firm operates the way he does always in the most professional manner he's also an important member of the new york community he is a very active chair of the harlem children's zone he's on the boards of the environmental defense fund of memorial sloan kettering and of the</p>
      <p>children's scholarship fund for me and i say this with complete sincerity it has been an utter privilege to have the ability to talk to him um most weeks for the last few years and i hope you will find that's true today as well please join me in welcoming stan druckenmiller hmm can i get a peek at the questions yeah when uh when i asked dan if he would uh if he would come do this he said so wait let me understand this all i have to do is listen to your questions and be honest with the answers and i said that's all you have to do he said fine i'll do it so let's start with uh your director of investments at a bank of tender age of 28.</p>
      <p>how did you learn to trade at a bank as a head of research well i started at i get i give you a little background i started at the bank at uh 23 i dropped out of graduate school because i want to get a phd in economics it took me about a semester and a half to figure that one going to work and i got a job in construction and then the only job i could get was at pittsburgh national and i started in the training program in a bank you're a teller you go through the credit department and everybody wants to go to the credit department uh and i thought i was pretty smart there were 12 of us had a pretty high opinion of myself and i went in after we went through the training program and the guy in credit said you couldn't sell snowmobiles in alaska if there was uh no other uh transportation vehicle there</p>
      <p>so we have no use for you anywhere in the bank um but but um there's a guy up on the 30th floor whose personality is worse than yours um who once who runs the trust department you know he's a great investors but um you should call him up and uh see if he'll hire you so i called the guy up and he said where'd you go to school and i said i meant university of michigan and before i got out he said if i went to michigan you're hired um so i went up there and uh i started uh as an analyst in the banking industry in the chemical industry and i'm doing that about a year and a half i think i was 25. this guy was really quirky okay and uh he got in a fight with the top management of the bank and no that was later i'm sorry so there were about eight eight guys in research</p>
      <p>and i've been there about a year and a half and he promoted me to be director research which is a little crazy because everybody else had an mba they had more experience and i'd like to say it was something to do with me but i think it was just this guy wanted to show them how powerful he was that he could make the make them all report this 25 year old so they all hated me and it was sort of working out uh because this guy protected me and then he got in a fight with the guy up above him so he's gone to eastern airlines and i'm there at i guess 26 now and there's the charitable guy there's the pension guy and there's the individual guy and then there's me director research all vying for power and um this this guy that ran the thing was a lawyer and he didn't understand anything about investments but he'd sit on the investment decisions they had made a</p>
      <p>decision about who was going to be director investments so the shaw of iran had just been overthrown i was 26 had more courage than brains um didn't know about diversification i said well this is pretty easy let's put 70 of our money in oil stocks and let's put 30 in defense um these guys all said well that's nuts you got to do diversification blah blah blah i said no that's what we should do and you know so um the lawyer's listening to this and he doesn't know anything and so my stock selection list went up 300 percent in two years the s p was flat bonds went down the tubes which i hated now if you asked me that question anytime in the next 10 years after i was more experienced i probably wouldn't have given that answer but that's how i became director research and this guy that mentored me even though he was quirky he was an investment genius and he was very trading oriented and</p>
      <p>actually very chart oriented which was good for me because when you get promoted at the age of 26 you never really learn fun and fundamental analysis and charts are kind of quicker and easier if you want to see what's going on so actually jeff i learned from this guy because uh he knew about things like if if all the news is great and the stock's not acting well get out which is pretty simple thing that for some reason most analysts don't know he taught me more what makes stocks go up and down than analysis itself which is it's it's 90 of the function but i'd say about 10 of the people is what they focus on so if we were just to jump over to the you know the technical versus fundamentals you're making an investment decision or a trading decision how do you how do you piece the two together how much time do you spend looking at charts today okay so every night</p>
      <p>at about 4 30 i get 272 charts they cover um just about every group in the stock market every commodity every currency cross i'm interested in every fixed income market around the world and they're basically daily weekly and monthly daily supposed to predict 8 to 20 days weekly 8 to 20 weeks and monthly 8 to 20 months when i make an investment decision it's usually sometimes believe it or not the idea comes from the charts but i will never invest just on a chart but if i really like a fundamental thesis and the chart stinks i won't do it there's you know my my old boss used to say in terms of socks i apologize to women in the audience there's 6 000 girls out there you know if 20 or 30 of them look great</p>
      <p>i don't need to bother with the rest and you can always find at least in terms of equities 20 or 30 great fundamental stories that the chart looks good but i always assume that the market may know something and i've always had a great deal of respect for the market so i'd say 75 to 80 of my ideas come from fundamental and then they're verified by the chart but i've also found ideas from the charts and then discovered the fundamentals the the charts we use because i took a shortcut to my career as you can hear charts were a great tool for me early on because i didn't learn a lot of the fundamentals in time but i did i was introduced to all the top chart systems um throughout 20 years and we ended up buying a system and bring it internally and because it used um second derivative rate of change these things will often bottom a year to</p>
      <p>a year and a half before the fundamentals so they'll give you time um to study the thesis so that's why sometimes the charts actually generate the initial idea and then go and try and find a story um before we get back to your career i just want to on the charting thing ask you about one trade you know i had lunch in in march of last year must have been a week or two after bear stearns failed and uh talking oh wait oh wait and yeah that's a bad week for me but go ahead no wonder you weren't eating much the uh and we were talking about commodities and you said look i'm as bearish as can be on the economy i don't get what's going on with commodities but my charts are telling me they're going up so i'm long every chart i now all the rest of us who were really bearish on the economy were short commodities how did you reconcile the fact that you're really bearish on the economy but you went long commodities because the charts told you to do that</p>
      <p>um my recollection uh is i just saw so much liquidity that was going to be provided um worldwide that i was willing to go with the charts i do remember the reason we did fine in 08 was around may or june those charts started to look quite dodgy and we got out but i i believe at that time it was pretty obvious to me that bernanke and company eric were just going to put petal the metal after bear stern so i was willing to believe the charts in terms of commodities the um back to you so you at some point you made a decision to leave the bank and start your own fund yeah what drove that how about running six billion dollars with the best record i knew and getting paid 43 grand a year i mean these guys</p>
      <p>you guys are complaining about what they're doing to you okay so most people reporting to me were making more money which i thought was a little weird my mentor had left and what really happened is i came up to new york to a dinner and uh i gave this presentation on uh gold and there was a guy at the dinner and uh he came up to me after and he said you don't sound like you're from a bank i said well i guess that's a compliment thank you apology's exciting and uh he said uh well why aren't you on your own i said well i'm 27 years old and frankly i don't have any money um and uh he said well how about if i pay you ten thousand dollars a month to talk to you you don't have to write any reports nothing i'll just pay ten thousand a month to talk to you</p>
      <p>so i was 28 oh and i came up and i interviewed with uh jp morgan because i was frustrated and i thought i was great in the interview and i didn't get the job i must not be able to sell um so um he told me he paid me 10 000 a month to talk to me a couple people that knew me through the bank were giving me 900 thousand dollars to manage times one percent with no performance fee was 9 000. 129 000 that's more than i was making i figured worst case i could i could come to new york and work for a bank if i fell on my face that's how it started now after working on your own for a while at some point you switched strategy right you went from being i guess a stock picking fund the long-only fund to what today we would recognize as a macro fund actually no um because my background was economics not business and it's true my first</p>
      <p>venue into at pittsburgh national analytically was stocks because i was the banking analyst and because of this guy i told you the quirky guy that mentor he was a top-down real good investor i learned about liquidity and i was very strong in bonds i didn't tell you in the meeting of a lawyer i kept telling anybody bonds weren't going to go down the tubes which they did but when i started duquesne it was 81 and i had a great first year or two because i put 50 percent of the capital in 30-year bonds which quite radical at the time because they were yielding 14 and henry kaufman said they were going to 25 and he was a guru and it was a little terrifying but so you're right i'd say it was more about when i started running money for dreyfus i started to get really more involved in currencies and bonds by by the time i had gone to soros he didn't know this he thought i was an s p guy trader but but</p>
      <p>i thought i knew a lot about bonds and currencies and it was actually bonds that launched my record at duquesne not not stocks so you went to soros and obviously there's a legendary trade happen there that it's basically your trade when uh you broke the bank of england or so they say can you tell us a bit about that okay um that was just one of these anomalies in history because britain and and germany were i'd say loosely economically linked and the deutsche mark and the pound were at a fixed rate i think it was 178 and the loose economic link was fine until germany decided to reunite with east germany and this created</p>
      <p>huge demand and basically the strongest economy in the world while while that was happening at the same time um the u.s banking crisis savings and loan thing was in full bloom and the uk for whatever reason even though we're on other sides of the ocean and so forth they were more correlating with our economy than with the european economy and particularly at that time the german economy so they were going into a housing recession while germany was first taking off from the reunification so you had one economy tanking the other economy going like this one requiring lower rates the bundesbank was going crazy threatening politicians and everything just raising rates continually and they had a very strong currency so the pound was getting dragged up with it so i watched this for a while</p>
      <p>and i was really screwed because i didn't have a chart it was just a fixed exchange rate so i couldn't cheat the way i usually do is look at look at my momentum curves but in august of that year um i looked and the six-month forwards were a half a percent well i figured it was a little bit of a long shot that i would win but if i did win it would be twenty percent it was a half a percent so we were managing 6 billion at the time so i did a billion and a half and just decided to sort of watch it so then um two weeks before the pound happened i got a call from a consultant in washington that the the germans weren't pleased at all with the italians and uh we did some lyra and that worked out um and then you know i was just going along and the forwards were starting to move a little but it was it</p>
      <p>was nothing dramatic at all and it was simple as i opened up the newspaper one morning and this guy schlesinger who's head of the bundesbank at the time has written an article basically announcing that it's just totally inappropriate for the for the pound if you read it you know how one learns to read central bank it's just totally inappropriate for these bozos to be linked to the great deutsche mark so i read it again because i couldn't believe my own eyes it was in the financial times so i decided to do um five billion dollars to basically with the one and a half take the fund fully invested short the pound so the arrangement i had with george which was not the arrangement the first six months i had there where there was no declared leader it was kind of a mess but by that time i was running the fund and he had his personal account which by the way was larger than most funds at the time um so when i was doing something</p>
      <p>significant i used to just make him aware and a lot of times he he'd piggyback in the f in his personal account on what i was doing so i went into him and i said i said george i just want you to know i'm going to do 5 billion dollars worth of the pound i only think i had told him about the billion and a half i've been wandering this for a while i went through the thesis and uh you know the whole economic pitch i gave you and he goes there that's ridiculous and uh i said excuse me uh george this is this is like this is like a layup he says exactly the point why are you only doing five billion dollars so he says this is a one-way this is a one-way bet that's not the way you know you manage risk you should do 15 billion dollars um because the forwards are still like half to three quarter of a percent that whole diversification lesson you learned is out the window now</p>
      <p>diversification is over very overweight we can talk about it later but anyway so you know i decided uh he was right and and that this was kind of a once-in-a-lifetime thing and it was the same day it was like two or three in the afternoon so i called city and a few other banks and we started and like went to bed had given those of you who know my traitor then he's still my traitor the infamous steve oaken um we got a guy back there who uh does a great imitation if you want to see it later i i'd love to see it and if you if you call on them my condolences but anyway um i get a call about one in the morning that uh this thing is a mess the forwards have completely blown out you know we're not going to get where you want to be i said well how much have we done he</p>
      <p>said like five or six billion and i said uh okay well where are the forwards and i said uh all right i'm going back to sleep oh you know i get up like 3 30 and i'll talk to you so got up and uh the british had raised their rates i i can't remember where they came from but they had raised them hugely to like 12 so uh at that point even though the forwards were out i knew they were finished because um their economy couldn't even handle whatever it was at the time i think it was eight or nine seven something like that but i said that you know if they're in a recession at seven 12 is going to do wonders for them so and and i knew they didn't have a political will so even with the forwards blown out we started to add even more because the fords i think were five or six or seven percent now and i knew that evaluation had to be 15 or 20. but we only got like two or three hundred million more on and all hell broke loose and then uh lorma norman lamont came out and they they went to 15</p>
      <p>but it was a joke and then uh like four hours later as it was uh history now you've got this big move you know you bet on it you broke them did you take profit at that point it's very interesting because we made 62 net that year and we were only up 16 on september the 14th but i think we only made uh about 20 in the pound the answer is no um it didn't go to where it should and we waited and waited and waited and then when it got to where i thought it could go like 16 or 20 we just started slowly bleeding it out but we actually made more money on the concentric circles than we made in the pound i don't know whether i've ever disclosed this but um</p>
      <p>the british guilts were down two points that morning not two ticks two points because it's a well-known theory in academia that if your currencies go down your bonds are going to go down it's a great theory everyone believes that the only problem is there's absolutely no basis for it if you look at history in fact if you looked at history you'd say the opposite except you'd be incorrect because you'd be saying you know eating ice cream causes hot weather but but generally when when a currency is very weak your bond market will go with it because it suggests the economy is weak so the gilts were down two points people are selling like crazy and we loaded up on gilts and they went up i think 33 points not ticks points in the next year we bought french motif bonds we bought british equities we bought all the things that i thought the blowing up of erm would affect and so we took our profits on the pound i think like six to eight weeks later and</p>
      <p>more importantly the other stuff fed us for about a year but you ask a great question because and this is this is not something i did but this is a great trading lesson i wasn't there but oaken will tell you the story because he was and this is this is this is a great investor's name is george soros and when plaza happened in 85 he was loaded to the brink with yen like already too big and all the little traders there we didn't have this when i was running quantum but they were they had their little 25 to 50 million capital pools so they were they were allowed to piggyback so they were all long yen because frankly george was long in so the next morning after plaza the yen opened up 800 ticks and george soros is an interesting guy but i worked for him for 12 years and i never</p>
      <p>heard him swear and i never saw much emotional change takes that would last with me for about four minutes if you're with me on a desk but um apparently these all these other guys started taking profits and he had an absolute heart attack stop it transfer all that stuff to me you know they're idiots and the thing you know thing went another 40 another 4 000 ticks so the easy thing emotionally was to take a profit and in fact george was adding and and taking that too because you know you can't just make yourself feel good by taking a profit when something goes your way you have to remember your original game plan your original thesis and why you thought it would go from if it's a to b wherever b is and you know so you know kind of on that theme but going the other way so people describe you as very disciplined</p>
      <p>at the same time i've seen you run positions that have gone against you in a long way i think about you know the yen and the 2005 period or the rio last year or the indonesian rupiah my worst memory of my life in 96 but let's leave that one out because it won't teach the lesson you're trying to teach here actually i think we'd like to hear about it about the rupiah sure oh boy um we had a we had a bigger hit in the thai bot than we had in uh in the british pound but they lent by then certain entities within our firm that were above me had learned to stay quiet um when we had a success but um unlike the british pound the thai bot was not my idea there was a guy uh that worked with us named rodney jones</p>
      <p>and he he he had worked for the bank of new zealand and he was out in asia and rodney had showed me this chart of thailand and loans to gdp had gone from some nominal amount to 150 percent he thought the whole thing could blow up put it on in february big position no no forward cost of the time and it blew up in uh july and um so we made a lot of money and we had a little bit of well not a little but we had a fair amount of malaysian ringgit so we're taking profits on the thai bot and the malaysian ringgit and uh i became convinced by someone at the firm i've conveniently forgotten who um that the washout was over now and that indonesia was different they didn't have the fundamental problems that thailand and and malaysia had turns out i had worse but um</p>
      <p>i don't quite know what was going on because i think suharto was funneling money out because the the macro numbers were fine but this thing was unbelievable i mean it just kept going and going and going and i couldn't get out and to some extent i was so big relative to the size of the market i froze but i lost well over a billion dollars in it and the worst year i ever had basically flat on the year so how do you size your trades you look at how many positions do you carry at once and how do you size any one trade well i think diversification is really overrated and i'm no i really do i i'm from the school of uh if you've really got a great thesis and you've and you've analyzed the risk award put all your eggs in a couple baskets or in one basket and then watch the basket very closely um but when i was when i was at soros</p>
      <p>a lot of my positions by the time we got over 10 billion particularly back then i always sized them relative to the market not to the capital of the fund so i would never get bigger i would never get so big in something that i i thought i couldn't get out where it would cost the fun maybe one or two percent in execution cost alone to get out so that was always a rule no matter how good um no matter how good the idea and and the pound thing is easy because i could have gotten out of i could have gotten out of the fixed exchange rate so that governed that um now back when i was younger and not as wealthy and probably had a lot more courage you know it's a lethal triple um i used to take my fund i'd put 150 to 200 percent of it in a currency i put 300 percent in 10-year bond equivalent</p>
      <p>um equities i really rarely would get more than 100 percent net long or rarely more than 50 net short but our our gross leverage very very rarely would run more than four to one but if i really really believed something i'd have no problem putting a hundred percent of the fund in it again with the liquidity strength i meant constraint i mentioned earlier and i i will say that unlike my competitors and who knows have the right model i learned very very very very early on because i think we were the biggest at the time at least for me it's very difficult to run a hedge fund with more than 10 billion dollars effectively and being from the equity school and having learned currencies and bonds i felt i had a lot of weapons so the funds that</p>
      <p>to me over 15 or 20 billion and still raising money i don't understand that and we have tried religiously to keep our assets around the 10 billion dollar level because my belief is if we let our assets blow up to 40 or 50 billion and a modestly we certainly could have any time in the last three or four years based on the record i would just have horrible performance and the assets would leave anyway so our philosophy has been to grow it organically and then when you get to 10 billion start squeezing clients out and manage your own money to try and keep it there because in the long run a i've got an ego problem so i like i like performing after a while it's not about the money you make it's about it's how you feel about yourself so that i guess i've given a very long answer to your question so let's get back to you so with indonesia it just kept going against you and you couldn't explain why and lost enough money that you were like i'm done with this</p>
      <p>what about something like brazil and la where you saw it go from 180 to 240. okay so brazilian 08 i think somebody gave you the wrong information because i had a problem with brazilian but it's instructive um i brought i brought bought brazil i think above 250 you know for and had held it for quite a while and as those of you know brazil i had quite a carry and uh armenia fraga had been a partner of mine for six or seven years uh at soros so i felt i knew brazil probably knew just enough to you know be dangerous but i thought i knew brazil pretty well and i'd owned it for a few years and frankly um at the low which was just through 160 and it was the first time the japanese started buying it by the way the whole way they had no interest from 310 to 160</p>
      <p>but at 160 they discovered the real um i i did take a bunch off because i just thought this is going to be very tough for brazil to exist with this exchange rate and then at 170 180 the chart turned dramatically so i think i had been 3 billion which was really really stretching the limits of what i would call liquidity but i liked it so much and it kind of grown there organically so i already violated the discipline rule i told you about but um i guess i had about a billion left when it went through 180 and but since i had had three billion i convinced myself it was okay because it was only go to like 205. and uh so it's at 2 40 you know it took a couple weeks and uh i thought this this is uh this is tough and uh so i barfed at least two or three hundred million</p>
      <p>right at the low the good news is some of you must know a nudge mahatra he bought it from me internally i have my own guy buy the low from me inside the duquesne but it stayed there for a while and i still liked brazil and i ended up adding between 240 and 220 and basically held a lot of it through about 180 or 190 and still have quite a bit i i think what you may be thinking of at the time is i i started buying brazilian rates at 13 or 14. and they've they violated every chart limit you could possibly think of they went to 19. and this is really really rare for me i don't know when i've ever done it in the past and i just kept adding because this is the stupidest thing i've ever seen it it's trading with risk but i think u.s</p>
      <p>two years were 40 basis points you know we kept lowering our rates and that was one of those rare cases where i ignored the charts i told you that i never ignored because i just thought it was just so fundamentally ridiculous and we held them all the way from 18 or 19 these were the january of o2s down to you know uh down to 10. we held that trade for years so is it really you know when you've got something that's like a 1 in 100 for me to violate to that extent when you're violating you're violating the charts it's the charts that'll signal to you to get out yeah we have no i have never used a stop loss in my career i don't use a like a number i know i know that's a discipline system and i know it works but i have like conditions if it starts not acting well relative to news or other things i'm watching you know i'll get out so i probably do have a stop loss in my head</p>
      <p>but it's like um another golden rule i has is is january 1 has always been a great resetting of risk for myself and for those of you who gamble you probably know that 95 of the people that go to vegas lose money but the odds are 33 to 32. so 95 percent of the people shouldn't lose money it's because people who get down want to go home and tell their spouse that they made money so they start betting big when they're on losing streaks um and then when they get out go get up they want to tell their spouse they made money so they like they're playing very small when they're doing well and they're playing bigger and bigger when they're doing poorly so we have always believed january 1 is sort of when the house starts and if i'm up i think this is the reason so far we haven't had a down year i'm sure we will have one at some point but when i'm up</p>
      <p>i'll play much more aggressively i i see a lot of managers to get up 20 oh i want to book my year i made my high water mark let's go to the beach i'm the opposite and frankly i learned that i learned a lot of that from george um if you're up 20 or 30 percent you're playing the house money that's when you try and get up 60 or 70 percent and you're usually hot at the time any of you who have managed money the most important thing is to manage to monitor yourself i don't know why streaks happen but they happen to happen in baseball they happen in putting they happen in money management and one of my jobs is to know whether i'm hot or cold but i will say just like the brazil thing if i'm down eight or nine percent on the year i'm playing very differently that i'm up 15 or 20 but if there's a great opportunity i'm not going to go oh i'm down on the year i'm going to put my head in the sand i'll play it it's just more of a it's an intuitive general feel the um another time you turned it around was 98 where you looked like you were going to miss the tech bubble</p>
      <p>and you were short going into the fall right i think you're thinking in 99 but um what this is a horrible period i i try to black this one you bring back all these nightmares but uh 99 was was the first time in my career and i started in 81 that i i felt my fund was really in trouble and i was in trouble psychologically and it really started in march of 99 i had i had shorted 200 million dollars worth of what i would call low quality internet stocks now mind you this was not early on aol was up eightfold yahoo was up these things had already gone way to the sky so i shorted 200 million dollars worth of internet stocks i would have done more but i have my liquidity rule and i lost about 800 million dollars in 13</p>
      <p>days they gapped open like 100 stock would open 130 you try and buy a little would be 170. so i took my i took my 800 million dollar loss i just said get me out you know discipline thing you're talking about indonesia taught me something so i had some currency trade not working and in may we were down 18 and i'd never had a down year and i'd had big drawdowns but always from like up 40 to up 20 or something so the summer wore on and you know i was watching this thing and my charts on the technology stocks looked incredible and it finally dawned on me that greenspan was responding the asian crisis but it wasn't appropriate for the united states so we were running a world monetary</p>
      <p>policy but rates were required much higher for here and the charts were just screaming at me to buy tech i think someone said the quote you said at the time was the fed was throwing a party and i was missing it well that's what i said that's what i said it sounds familiar so so i loaded up on tech stocks and uh i think we ended up 42 net on the year and we are still down eight in early november so we made about five billion dollars in november and december all in tech stocks i might as well keep going because the next part's a real nightmare and this is a this is a lesson in money management so in january we still own these tech stocks and we're now up 13 but a lot of my technical indicators were horrendous i mean i think there were 13 new highs</p>
      <p>and 242 new lows on a uh year-over-year basis but the market was going up it was all like 10 or 15 tech stocks so i sold everything and was flat and up 13 i went into george and told him why i did it he said that's great you know well i had these two internal managers that i had hired um to buy the go-go tech stocks the ones i didn't know how to pronounce verisign veritas i only knew old stuff like ibm and hewlett-packard who would help me gun the fund in in 99 my god they were making six or seven percent a day while i was sitting out and i just couldn't stand it and uh completely lost my cool and my discipline and after being out for a few weeks and they'd made another 30 or something i jumped back into the tech market and to be fair my momentum charts were bullish but they were bullish</p>
      <p>they were bullish for an equity chart but i had seen commodity charts do this and just fall out of the sky because again my stuff is rated change and second derivative anyway i i bought these tech stocks all back and uh about a month and a half later i was down 18 again it was like the nightmare of uh the year before and the worst thing is i knew when they were down when i was down one percent i knew i was toast and uh i just started liquidating told george that i couldn't take it anymore i was leaving and uh told him i was gonna sell everything and we could have a press conference about three weeks but i want to get out of my stuff first and uh went on uh went on sabbatical sent a letter out to my duquesne investors and said my head's all screwed up um i'm gonna uh i'm gonna take a break um you can leave the fund and that's fine um by the way if you</p>
      <p>leave it i you won't necessarily get back in if you want to come back in but uh no charge if you stay in we lost one account and uh by labor day that was made by labor day because i had nothing else to do because my kids were going back to school i came back and uh i've had a lot of luck in my life but this was maybe one of the luckiest things ever because i came back in late august right around labor day and oil was screaming upward interest rates were screaming upward it had this huge rally back in the s p and the tech stocks that i had sold and uh everything i had ever looked at told me we're gonna we're gonna go in a recession and plus the nasdaq had been down 30 or 35 percent and uh i had the analysts that i rehired called some companies they all said business</p>
      <p>stunk and everybody on wall street was you know 18 earnings and um ed hyman had this simple little model uh 50 dollar 50 g7 rates and i can't remember what the other 25 percent g so i can't remember that anyway it spit out earnings are going to be down 36 percent in the next 12 months and wall street strategists had them up 18 okay so i'm not a rocket scientist but up 18 down 36 and this thing had fit like a glove for one and it fit with everything i believe so fed funds were six and a half two years for 604. we were down at new cane we weren't down 18 we were down nine but i i thrown i finally have a down year that's it it's over man this looked like red meat in front anybody who hadn't had a steak in about 10 years and uh i was fresh the four months off it really helped so i literally put 300 10-year equivalent of the fund</p>
      <p>in two-year notes and we made like we made a lot of money um in in the next few months and then ended up i don't know around 15 or 20 nets something like that but that was that was like a miracle so what is it you think that makes a good trader i mean i know you got a lot of friends who are pretty legendary traders all the different styles you've had a lot of people work for you people that you've worked for what is the the common denominator well i i'd say first of all they're extremely competitive you know they want they have an unbelievable will to win and that just if you look at any anybody with a great investment record for whatever reason the people without passion can't compete with them because they have passion and they're willing to just work work harder and and you're in the wrong arena if you think you can compete with those maniacs if you don't have that passion number two um they may have very very different styles</p>
      <p>but they're all disciplined and i just told you about four times i wasn't disciplined but um that's over about 30 years it doesn't even matter what your system is but as long as you follow it there are a lot of ways to make money and and with regards to that you really really have to fight your emotions because i have wanted to sell every bottom so bad and a lot of times i'm buying there i'm always doing it never feels great when you're out of turn the other thing i have found is that contrarian investing is is way overrated people tend to um they tend it's intellectually cool to not be with the crowd but the crowd makes 80 money 80 of the time and and they kill themselves at the turns and end up losing as much as it turns as they make during the 80 percent of the time</p>
      <p>but i have found contrarian thinking just to be contrarian can be a death trap particularly particularly in uh bonds and currencies because economic fundamentals are what they are it can be a rough ride if it's very crowded but i i think the main thing jeff is you have to be disciplined you have to be unemotional and to me the really great ones you have to really be able to play you have to have courage you have to play big when when the opportunity's there make hay while the sun shines whatever the term is one more question before we take some q a you know we're we've brought all our foreign exchange and local market traders from the americas and a few from asia and europe here today to talk about over the next two days how to grow your risk how to grow how to grow your risk how to take more how to get bigger um you seem to have no problem</p>
      <p>driving it although you had the help from a mentor to push yourself to get bigger to take more risk are there any other besides having someone push you what helps you be confident enough to step it up to the level i think you just have to follow you know whatever your whatever your style or whatever your system is you just have to follow a disciplined pattern and you have to teach yourself that you're good i mean i can remember in 87 and 88 in 80 in 87 i caught the crash and i was on a couple magazine covers so i was really smart okay but i was convinced we were going into a depression and 88 the stock market kept going i can remember getting up two nights a week throwing up and thinking oh my god i went to boden i never got a degree i can't be a plumber what i'm going to do this this might be random what what you know i might have just gotten lucky for six years because</p>
      <p>you're a bull market playing a trend and you know i had made 42 a year compounded and i was thinking that way so it's not easy but i think if you follow a disciplined system you just have to watch your own results and you have to believe in yourself and success breeds success and again one of the things with me is i know when i'm hot and i know when i'm cold and you have to learn to play big when you're on a streak a lot of times when i'm cold i'll just start trading really small and the whole purpose of the trading is to find out when i've got it again and every once in a while you'll think you'll got it and you hit eight in a row and then you bet big and ooh i missed and that's tough that's probably the toughest thing you could ever do that's the old whip saw term but you know you just have to dust yourself off but i would say the way to get big is follow discipline watch yourself and then just grow organically what i would never do ever</p>
      <p>is if you swing and you miss is put on a big trade just to get even i got to get out of the trap that is a death that's a death sentence don't bet big and unless a you love your thesis and b you're hot now if you really really love your thesis and you've had a lot of successes in the past that's what i'm talking about for example when i put that treasury bet on when i came back in 2000 that's fine but don't ever bet big just because you think this is the you know the way to get out of a mistake you've made so when you're losing i think this is key get small keep trading was 2000 the only time where you said that's it i really gotta get my head out of this i'm gonna square everything up and go away yeah jeff i was exhausted i'm it had more to do with all sorts of psychological factors which you have to know when you're a trader but i had been running the most public hedge fund for 12 years with a guy</p>
      <p>who had a need for publicity because his his philanthropy and his status were enhanced i don't think he was doing it at the time because of his ego it enhanced his position in philanthropy well i'm a private person as you know if you try and find anything out on duquesne and i was just tired and exhausted and in 99 i think money managed a little bit like a boxer and body blows you get these body blows and 99 took a lot out of me and do it 2 000 and my kids were 9 or 10 i just so yeah that's the only time i did it but let me tell you there have been 10 times when i wanted to do it and at those times i i just trade small suck it up and try and remember all the successes i've had in the past and this will end at some point i'm really not that stupid which at the time you feel like you are all right uh why don't we take a few questions anyone want to kick off peter</p>
      <p>of success not not early but after a mature string of success is when they're at their worst they get sloppy they get overconfident um so i would kind of disagree and i i just want to ask you specifically why do you think that when someone's doing well that it's a time to take more risks well i i believe in streaks and i don't know whether you do disagree because what you're talking about is someone who loses their discipline um and you cannot allow you make a good point you cannot allow yourself when you're doing well to start thinking your god and lose your discipline but i i do believe that life and trading runs in streaks and if you're still disciplined without with what you're doing when you're up 20 with clients money you have the right</p>
      <p>if you really like an idea to bet more than when you're down 10 percent and i'm not saying oh i'm up 20 let's go shoot for the moon what i am saying everything else equal if you're playing with house money and if you're doing well and you're trading well you should definitely take bigger positions otherwise but no i'm not saying i'm up 20 let's just get and i've hit eight in a row let's get reckless so i'm not sure we do disagree i may not have articulated my position well but if if you look at the best part of my record at soros i literally didn't make a mistake for five years literally not one and then for two years i stunk okay and if i had gone in any of those five years from basically 89 to 95 well i've done too well i need to take a break you know i probably would have lost half</p>
      <p>my net worth that i have now so different strokes for different folks tom yeah when we of had a uh that the risk management system was you um and i think it might be interesting yeah if you talk a little bit about how you thought of the money i don't remember when you walked in but this is a terrific question um because i have never had a well i did but i am paying attention to it and it's what tom's alluding to i have never had a fancy quantitative risk management control system overseeing me and by the way either did george soros</p>
      <p>in the 25 years he ran the fun before i did and between us there's one down years since 1969. there's no var at duquesne well there was because the banks came in and made us put it in uh after 98. okay but i believe that every once in a while usually about every 10 years you have a financial crisis and all these systems that are based on historic trends and what happens when a does this and b does this spit out a formula and they work 90 95 of the time but when when you really really need risk management they break down because by definition of a financial crisis which i'm sure everybody here knows because we had a recent one correlations just go wacko</p>
      <p>um the stuff that has correlated for years breaks down and you start seeing changes that make no sense whatsoever and my risk management system is and i i believe this is true with george although we never talked about it you know if i own let's say in today's world uh the last 10 years at least if if you own stocks and your short bonds that most of those 10 years has been the same bet and if you're long the euro that's probably a long risk bet and you just kind of get a feel in your head of where your matrix is and i can go in the gym and watch cnbc um at 11 o'clock and i have probably if you include the whole firm hundreds of positions on and all i see on that stupid little ticker is what the s p is</p>
      <p>doing and i can probably tell you our p l within two million dollars just because my head knows what my pound or my euro position will be doing and my goal position based on that and so i sort of have this internal thing where i'm watching everything but the reason i love the human side as opposed to the quantitative side is there's nothing like my p l and you will pick up oh c is not acting the way it was with a the last eight years and there's something funny and then you'll start seeing more funniness going on and i have always thought that if my p l extra if things went well that day and i'm losing money and i examine what went on and if that continues something is really starting to go haywire in the system so my risk management system has always been what i've described that knowledge and then my gut and watching my daily p l</p>
      <p>and if the daily p l starts acting in a way it shouldn't instead of going to some quantitative var or beta model oh i'm okay the model says i'm okay to me these models are not only okay they can get you in huge trouble by causing you a false sense of security um when when things start going awry because the model will tell you you're okay and and you will see things happen you've never seen before whereas if if you are a intuitive human traitor you should be able to use your instinct to just start cutting when things aren't acting right you ever if you're thinking about the correlations if you're along a lot of smps we say well i'm bullish the euro bearish the dollar but i'm not going to take that big position in that because they're correlated yeah and and that gets back to this question if if i've got a strong opinion and i'm doing well and we're up 20 percent</p>
      <p>and this is what happened in the early 90s and i've got eight positions and they're all in the sec same direction it's an eight times texas hedge i have no issue with it but if i'm down six or seven percent i might just take my favorite of those positions and press that alone but but yeah i am constantly um weighing that and and you know one of the one of the one of the reasons i plowed into those brazilian bonds is they had traded with risk since i'd owned them it was crazy a couple times they moved 200 basis points because you had something going on here and it had nothing to do with the brazilian economy and about a month before they turn before big signal they turned was the s p kept crashing into the financial crisis and they stopped correlating</p>
      <p>and that they were 18 or 19 and that's when i knew they were golden because i had watched some trade with risk for two years and my antenna the intuitive part i'm talking about i said oh they're not trading with risk and this is a really cool thing because i'm long them and i actually that's when i bought more of them all right one more scott uh i am the worst hirer in the world um and you know my mother-in-law says i'm an idiot savant she's probably right i you know so far i've been able to compound money above a random level but um i just i just took that to someone else in my firm</p>
      <p>so um if i was hiring a money manager the first thing i'd look for is if all i heard was they never made a mistake and they're telling me about all their wins that's a big red flag um the great money managers i've met they generally don't tell you about a lot of their wins they tell you about a lot of the losses um and there's a there's an immodesty about them but yeah i would definitely look for discipline um the first thing i do when i look at the records i go right to the bear market periods and see how they did in those uh and look at the quality of the record because i hiring money managers i'm okay actually it's analysts that i have a problem with but um yeah i would i would look at all the things i'm talking about but i think you can learn a ton from the record just by looking how they did in certain years and when you see an outlier you ask them</p>
      <p>because there'll be there'll always be one or two inconsistencies in there like i was flat in 96 pretty easy year why turns out it was the indonesian rupiah but um you know and i think you need to delve in what the reasons were in those unusual unusual period or are they just a bull market creature where they wrote a trend what are your thoughts on the markets today going forward any big views how are we going to make money next year well i i've had i i believe maybe the worst year i've had relative the opportunity we're up about 10 percent somewhere in that area and i think the opportunities have been tremendous this year by hindsight of course i i made the decision we had a very good 07 and a good 08. when that when the government got involved to the extent that they did and look at all the factors that my skill set</p>
      <p>was was not as valuable as it had been in the past because i was dealing with a set of variables that i just i didn't want to bet big and jeff i still think this is one of the most unanalyzable periods i've ever dealt with because i tend to look at history and historical i try to find similar instances and i was on a roll until september of 08 because it looked like the 30s but worse to me because we came in with more leverage and then we started running a monetary in a fiscal policy exact opposite of what we did in the 30s as well now so that's my big qualifier or hedge since i run a hedge fund um and i'll start out by saying this is this is more uncertainty that i would usually have and no one knows and if you meet anybody who really thinks they know what's happened next year stay away from because they're an idiot okay um but</p>
      <p>having said that here's how i here's how i see where we are um first of all usually in a in a big time financial crisis and we've seen this in a lot of emerging markets usually something really productive comes out of it and you usually get very positive structural reform now i am no fan of george bush for those of 43 for those of you who have known me for quite a while but i do think it was kind of bad luck at least for for structural reform that this thing blew up um on on the smaller government side of the equation's watch um and i blame that guy for a lot of things but i don't blame him for the financial crisis to me the the seeds of this started 20 years ago when greenspan took over for volcker and then he decided he won a recession so we've just been you know we've gone from 140 percent of gdp to 380 on debt</p>
      <p>and you know it went parabolic and he ignored it so the the problem i see is we had this big mess and instead of getting healthy response to it which would be demanded in an em country and an em country would come out of it usually much better and a lot of times rise from the ashes which is why i think if you look probably the countries that weathered the this the best were obviously latin american asia asia went through the asian financial crisis and the latin american countries were on their deathbed in the early 80s and they were they they they made the right response to it eventually and the seeds of that and the benefits of that went for a long time and i i think the last really horrendous thing i saw in my career was was this whole 70s thing in the end of it and carter was sort of the epitome of it and out of carter we got volcker</p>
      <p>and we got reagan and we basically got a 20-year bull market out of some guys that were really to take some serious serious pain for two or three years so my problem with with where we are today is we went into this thing we have this thing and not only have we not gotten structural reform we've done everything wrong and it's all kicked the can down the road and we got into this thing through a to me a reckless monetary policy and not willing to take the pain and not willing to take a recession and ironically i call it the curse of the reserve currency which is you know this thing the curse of oil that the country is well under the ground can yeah the problem with being a reserve currency is we're allowed to get away with non-reform and and behavior and you keep doing it and doing it and doing it and normally the markets would give you a signal and they would save you from yourself</p>
      <p>before it was too late i am deeply afraid that all this stuff we're doing it's the wrong answer i mean capping capping bankers pay this is this our response and all this other stuff why don't we just get you know knock down you know instead of dealing with the real issue which is leverage to lose a monetary policy you know it's all this populist nonsense out there so i am convinced that this crisis we've just had is going to be followed by a bigger crisis because we didn't do what we needed to do in response to this crisis and now is where it gets unanswerable and unanalyzable which is our response to it which is how we got into it which is more liquidity you know let's not have any pain 10 percent unemployment buying 20 to 25 billion in</p>
      <p>either treasuries or mortgages a week makes everybody feel good causes another asset bubble but it's going to cause hell down the road and and in this one i think the fed and the treasury were big enough to arrest it at the next one i think there's a good chance that they'll be the problem i think we're going to have a sovereign crisis due to everything we're doing now and normally it would be arrested because the bond market would give you a signal but with china trying to hold their own currency down so they're buying treasuries korea everybody knows who's intervening every night brazil will be intervening and we're intervening i mean we're buying 20 to 25 billion isn't it nice that that we don't want to we don't want to target asset prices at the fed on the way up but for some reason we're buying them isn't that targeting but anyway um so</p>
      <p>that this liquidity that they're putting in there you can't go oh the economy stinks so i hate the stock market it doesn't work um this thing if you have the money supply growing a lot faster than industrial production the stock market is generally going to go up that's just the way it works that's that's where the money goes but at some point we're going to get a signal when that signal is i don't know it could be in three months or it could be in three years so basically i'm pretty useless other than telling you i would not be shocked at all if we take out the 680 and the s p again on the downside but that could be in three or four years if you put a gun to my head i'd say given where liquidity is now if january earnings are strong and i i suspect they will be and the markets are hot enough these guys will end qe at the end of march is what they're saying uh if we get weak again i'm not sure i</p>
      <p>believe them but if they end qe i would be willing to entertain the fact since all my long-term thesis tend to happen before i think they're going to happen that it'd be very unlikely that risk would be up year to year in 2010 that sometime in the first quarter before the end of march we'll start backtracking when the big crisis comes i don't know i personally we're playing a low gross because i can't figure it out uh we are tilted toward long risk we're we're in the liquidity thing um my favorite currency is gold again very popular not a contrarian vet but my thesis there is quite simple that just like we had an anomaly in 92 with germany and britain we have an</p>
      <p>anomaly now and the anomaly is if you look at the world balance sheet it's it's okay in total but it's obviously ridiculously imbalanced so our structurally impaired balance sheet is somebody else's decent balance sheet so debt to gdp in china is 120 130 here it's 370 and you know you could go on but that's so basically because we're we're the reserve currency and because no one else wants their currency to go up we are running moral monetary policy and since we are have a structurally impaired balance sheet for the world as a whole that monetary policy is way too loose it's appropriate for us possibly i don't think it is but you could certainly argue it is it's definitely not appropriate for the world and everybody hates their own currency and that's why i like gold and then we're all so long a bunch of commodity currencies basically for the same reason but i would put</p>
      <p>gold at the bottom of gold at the top if i was from mars of my currency regime followed by selective commodity currencies and i would put the pound and the dollar at the bottom of us because they have structural problems bonds are incredibly interesting because they are the stupidest price they are ridiculous but again my discipline requires um i'm not just a value guy i need charts i need catalyst and i think they're a one-way bet except kerry but the carry's big um but i am salivating um to short the bond market in major size um that could happen tomorrow morning it could happen in four months it could happen a year i don't quite know but you know do i have a second yeah okay so so in 81 what launched my career was we had</p>
      <p>18 short-term rates we had about 14 or 15 inflation and the long bomb was yielding 14. and we had a crazy guy running the fed named paul volcker who was going to do anything to smash inflation and all the bond guys were bearish and it cost 400 they got 400 basis points of carry by being short bonds okay and interestingly the only bond bulls were equity guys michael steinhardt roy neuberger george soros myself although nobody ever heard of me um and we could see that this guy volcker was going to win okay now it's a very interesting situation it costs you 400 basis points not to own the bonds but to be short the bonds we got in my opinion a crazy guy running the fed okay he's hell-bent on inflating the bond guys are all bullish because they're getting 400 carry they they</p>
      <p>can't believe how what a party they're having the equity guys are all going this is a disaster when i go and i meet ceos every one of them thinks we're gonna have inflation i don't know whether right or not but you know so to me it's almost the mirror of 30 years ago when was george soros's one down year 1981 he lost 22 percent why he was long bonds he was just six months early i don't want to be six months early and trash myself but i'm salivating but it's you know i don't know the timing of it and last question your uh personal life one thing that is well known is your big steelers fan you're on the boards of a bunch of uh of charities but i know that your real focus is with the harlem children's zone why did you pick that one well i i hit the lottery um with this guy canada but but basically it's a pretty simple story um when i went to work for for george he had just retired</p>
      <p>from money management and he he he wanted to give away 500 million a year i had no money so i never thought about philanthropy but when i started making money i had a i had a personal mentor and it was just it seemed like the right thing to do but living in new york um first of all i'm kind of parochial because i came from pittsburgh so i wasn't really into the arts and i thought giving to the philharmonic and the moma was i don't know they seem to have plenty of money and plenty of supporters and i had a good friend i just met named paul jones and you know we were we had a lot of discussions about poverty in the area so i joined the robin hood board and we had a board meeting up with the site at this place called reedlin center for for children and families and i went up this sort of like dilapidated stairs up into this little room and uh i meet this guy jeff canada and within like an hour and a half the hair was standing back on the back of my i said</p>
      <p>this is like one of the greatest most dynamic leaders i've ever met what's he doing in this little room and then uh five or six years later i was on the real board it was jeff not me that thought up the concept of harlem children's zone presented to a board i mean this is like discovering you know bill gates in a garage uh as far as i'm concerned and and uh so you know he's he's he's had a massive impact with a hundred square blocks up there and now as you guys probably know obama's trying to use our model to do it in 20 cities and uh it's it's outside of my family it's been the joy of my life but i just got lucky and uh i don't know why i was destined to meet this guy but i did i just want to take one minute and i want to introduce arnold prasad my boss he runs fxlm uh you guys should know me by now at least this time of the year no we are a top bank guys</p>
      <p>thank you very much thank you comments thank you for coming and jeff thank you for posting it uh we have a surprise for you stan oh god so since you're a man that uh likes to follow these markets and likes to melt for his times is jeff canada somewhere here oh there he is i didn't mean any of that stuff i said about him hey how are you so um so stan we thought we'd want to do something for you coming here and spending the time with us and then we realized that we are government-owned bank with limited screwed with limited resources and no one wants to pay us but anyway we asked the senior managers</p>
      <p>of the bank to put some uh put to put a donation together for the harlem children's zone and they did and we've raised a hundred and forty thousand dollars well thank you thank you very much very proud to present you so that is from most most of senior managers in the in the markets area well i know what the government's doing to you so i know 140 000 is not what it used to be it's a lot more so thank you very much thanks a lot deeply appreciated and um i would just ask just so we can talk about what happens next anyone who's in the fx element part of our meeting if you could stay for a couple minutes and we'll just tell you where we're going everyone else thanks for taking the time to come thank you thanks jeff</p>
