<p>YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS AND WHAT YOU SAY ABOUT THE CRISIS IN THE MARKETS AND LET'S GO BACK TO WHAT WE HEARD IN OCTOBER WHEN WE SPOKE AT A CONFERENCE AND SAID THAT YOU WERE SHORTING U.S. TREASURYS AND I THINK IT WAS 10% TO 15% OF YOUR PORTFOLIO AT THAT TIME AND YOU ARE STILL SHORTING TREASURYS BASED ON WHAT YOU'RE WATCHING? >> I STILL HAVE SHORTENED TREASURIES, AND I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SURPRISED BY INTEREST RATES RISING AFTER THE CUT AND OF COURSE, WE WEREN'T BECAUSE I THOUGHT THE FED WAS MAKING A MISTAKE, AND I WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE SAME ANIMAL SPIRITS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AND OF COURSE, OUR HORRENDOUS FISCAL SITUATION. HAVING SAID THAT, WE'VE COME QUITE A WAYS AND WE'RE PROBABLY IN THE 7th INNING AND YOU CAN MAKE A LOT OF MONEY FROM THE SEVENTH INNING AND WHO KNOWS? IF THE FED'S STIMULUS WITH THE KIND OF ANIMAL SPIRITS I TALKED ABOUT WOULD GIVE YOU UPWARD INFLATION WHICH IS NOT OUR FORECAST, BUT WE'RE DEFINITELY OPEN MINDED TO IT AND WE'RE NOT</p>
<p>EXPECTING LOWER INFLATION AND THAT COULD TIP THE BOND MARKET AND CREATE A PROBLEM. SO WE ARE STILL SHORT TREASURYS, BUT WE'RE CERTAINLY NOT PRESSING THE SIZE OF THAT POSITION NOW. >> YOU SAID IN A PERFECT WORLD, STAN, THAT YOU'RE NOT A FAN OF TARIFFS, BUT THAT IT COULD BE POTENTIALLY THE LESSER EVIL IF IT'S DONE IN MODERATION. >> YEAH. I DON'T WANT TO EXIT THIS INTERVIEW AS TARIFF MAN [ LAUGHTER ] >> IN A PERFECT WORLD I WOULD NOT BE FOR A 10% TARIFF, BUT WE'RE NOT IN A PERFECT WORLD. AS YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A BIG FISCAL PROBLEM, MANDATORY SPENDING PLUS INTEREST EXPENSES, LITERALLY 100% OF REVENUES RIGHT NOW, AND BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE HAVE SAID THEY ARE NOT ABOUT TO CUT ENTITLEMENTS WHICH IS THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM. HAVING SAID THAT, BECAUSE OF THAT, WE NEED PAY FORCE. SO OUR MAIN CHOICES ARE AN</p>
<p>INCOME TAX AND A CONSUMPTION TAX LIKE TARIFF. SO WHEN I SAY TARIFFS ARE THE LESSER OF THE TWO EVILS IN TERMS OF THOSE TWO, BECAUSE THEY HAVE A FISCAL PROBLEM, WE NEED REVENUES. TARIFFS WILL GENERATE REVENUES. WE ALSO HAVE A PRIVATE SAVINGS IN THIS COUNTRY, THEY'RE FAR TOO LOW. I THINK THEY'LL BE FINE WITH A CONSUMPTION TAX. TO ME, TARIFFS ARE SIMPLY A CONSUMPTION TAX THAT FOREIGNERS PAY FOR SOME OF IT. THE RISK IS RETALIATION, BUT AS LONG AS WE STAY IN THE 10% RANGE, AND I THINK SO-CALLED FEAR OF DONALD TRUMP, I THINK -- I THINK THE RISK IS OVERBLOWN RELATIVE TO THE REWARDS. THE REWARDS ARE HIGH AND IT'S MORE OF THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS. >> YOU KNOW, STAN, YOU HAD SAID BEFORE THE ELECTION THAT YOU WOULD NOT BE VOTING FOR KAMALA HARRIS. YOU WOULD NOT BE VOTING FOR DONALD TRUMP.</p>
<p>PART OF YOUR CONCERN WAS, I THINK WHAT YOU CALLED BIPARTISAN FISCAL RECKLESSNESS ON THE PART OF ALL PARTIES AT THIS POINT. YOU'VE BEEN VERY CONCERNED ABOUT OUR SPENDING LEVELS AND NOT GETTING THAT UNDER CONTROL, BUT SCOTT BESSENT HAS BEEN TAPPED TO BE THE INCOMING TREASURY SECRETARY. HE'S SOMEONE YOU KNOW WELL. YOU WORKED WITH HIM AND HE WORKED WITH YOU AT THE SOROS FUND AND YOU WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH HIM. I THINK YOU KNOW HIM WELL. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE APPOINTMENTS BEING NAMED WHEN IT COMES TO LOOKING AFTER THE FISCAL SIDE OF THINGS AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT AND WHAT YOU MIGHTSI, OR AT LEAST WHEN IT COMES TO THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT. WHAT YOU MIGHT ANTICIPATE. >> SCOTT'S EXTREMELY CAPABLE. BIG BRAIN, VERY THOUGHTFUL, HE'S IN THE UNIQUE POSITION THAT I DON'T THINK ANY OTHER TREASURY SECRETARY HAS BEEN IN WHERE HE'S BEEN AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN MARKETS. I'M HEARING HE'S BEEN TO 40</p>
<p>COUNTRIES. I KNOW HE'S BEEN INVOLVED IN MARKETS IN AT LEAST 40 SO HE'S EXTREMELY CAPABLE. HE UNDERSTANDS HIS FISCAL SITUATION. I THINK HE UNDERSTANDS THAT THE BIGGEST RISK TO THIS ADMINISTRATION IS BOTH FISCAL AND INFLATION. HAVING SAID THAT, HE'S NOT IN CHARGE. HE'S EXTREMELY PERSUASIVE. HE HAD NO PROBLEM E ING ME MANY TIMES WHEN WE WORKED TOGETHER, BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW IT'S GOING TO WORK OUT. THIS IS A HUGE, HUGE PROBLEM HE INHERITS. THE DEFICIT IS CURRENTLY AT 6.7% OF GDP. IT'S $1.9 TRILLION. THE LAST TIME WE WERE AT FULL EMPLOYMENT WAS 2017, IT WAS 3.4% WE ALSO HAVE PEACE, SO WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IN THE CAMPAIGN SAID HE'S GOING TO NOT HAVE TAXES ON TIPS, NOT HAVE TAXES ON SOCIAL SECURITY. SO THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON. THERE'S SOME HOPE ON DOJ.</p>
<p>I'VE HEARD THE OPTIMISTIC ASSESSMENTS. I HOPE THEY'RE TRUE. I'M TOO OLD AND TOO CYNICAL TO REALLY SEE A LOT OF THAT STUFF HAPPENING. IF THEY COULD CUT $200 OR $300 TRILLION OUT, THAT WOULD BE GREAT. IF WE COULD GET SAY, $1 TRILLION OR MORE OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS OUT OF TARIFFS, THAT WOULD HELP. BUT WE'RE JUST IN A MESS, BECAUSE INTEREST EXPENSE IS JUST A HUGE, HUGE GROWING ELEPHANT AND IT'S ABOUT DEFENSE</p>
