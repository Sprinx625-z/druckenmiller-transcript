<p>for those that missed it earlier this year's sewn corporate sponsor tigas has come up with a fun idea for sewn attendees they've offered to Source a custom expert call for anyone in this own audience which you can do at tegus.com sewn hopefully some of those calls will be used to investigate the ideas that have been presented so far today we move now to an incredibly interesting interview Stan druckenmiller is the founder CEO and chairman of the Duquesne family office he's one of the most successful and legendary investors of all time with an incredible investing track record across decades and through a variety of Market environments he's also a student of history and I'm sure that his ideas today will be sobering informative and balanced Sam aldman said earlier that he tries not to make macro predictions but Stan is in that business so I expect some macro thoughts that will leave us all thinking Stan is being interviewed by Carol sokoloff the founder of 13d research and strategy Carol 2 is a student of markets in history and brings Decades of perspective making him the perfect</p>
<p>person to steer the conversation and get into the most important topics with Stan gentlemen over to you it's always such a great pleasure to be with you I can't think of anyone in the world I'll talk to you right now last year you told me you thought the U.S recession would arrive in the last half of 23. or early 24 but he recently told me that he brought your recession forecast forward you're hearing lots of anecdotal information from the CEOs you talked to problems in trucking problems in retail obviously credit contraction issues and you believe that the consensus of a staff Landing is very unlikely and you rate the probabilities of a hard Landing as white after all how could we not have a hard Landing after 11 years of the greatest monetary stimulus in U.S history</p>
<p>a 500 basis point increases short rates over the past year the developing real estate crisis in commercial real estate Regional banks have 33 percent of their allowance in that sector and the bursting of the everything could you please elaborate on this thank you Carol always good to see you um you conveniently left out um part of the punch line which was when we talked I told you that I've been doing this for 45 years I have to make economic forecasts for a living and this is easily the most challenging period you have a confident forecast I've had in my career you've just articulated some of the reasons um the extreme monetary policy and then the abrupt change but covered figures kind of mess everything up I'm trying to figure out</p>
<p>what what the momentum coming out of covid is is just that and is real or is not real or sustainable or it's not sustainable then you go through Ukraine war then you've got the whole China reopening so I I want to qualify anything I say it was saying in terms of confidence um it's not as much as I would usually have not that uh economic forecasting is is an exact science anyway but but we do know a few things um thanks to you it was your recommendation I read Edward Chancellor's the price of time um as you know I've been saying for years that my observation was the worst uh economic outcomes tended to follow asset bubbles I was only looking uh at the past hundred years or so and</p>
<p>um Edward Chancellor's book and in a real tour de force describes how this has been going on for over 500 years and basically every time you've had interest rates below two percent going back 500 years it's generally been followed um with with difficult Economic Times so if you look at the the current menu um I think it was actually just just a little over two years ago I went on national television and said we had monetary policy that was the most Reckless and extreme relative the economic circumstances I had ever seen and at that time inflation was two and a half percent you had a booming economy you were coming out because covet and it was clear both vaccine that we were we were on our way to maybe the most rapid recovery I had seen in my lifetime</p>
<p>um I was not surprised about a year later than an inflation reached nine percent I was not surprised that specs went crazy Bitcoin went crazy Dogecoin went crazy uh equities went crazy what I was surprised by was that for the next year while all that happened um Jerome Powell's fed continued to have their foot on the gas they continued to buy 120 billion dollars a bond a month while rates were zero um this obviously led to everything I described then um realizing they had probably made the biggest mistake in the history of the FED they slammed on the brakes um they've raised rates 500 basis points in the last year um we know historically two things which you've already articulated number one</p>
<p>um the worst economic outcomes tend to follow uh too easily engineered um asset Bubbles and number two big maximum my business don't fight the Fed so I'm sitting here staring in the face at the biggest asset and probably the broadest asset bubble forget that I've ever seen that I've ever studied it went on for 10 or 11 years and then it's the grand finale um the government spent 5 trillion on coved the FED financed 60 percent of it and as I just described now we now we have a big hike in interest rates um it's hard to look at that constellation of factors know that we've only had a few soft Landings since 1950 all of them were preceded by what I would call Proactive rather than reactive fed policy</p>
<p>and believe we're going to have a soft Landing one never knows but if you're just looking at the odds they're very tough in terms of the timing um I have left much less certainty on that than I do on whether we're going to have a hard Landing or a soft Landing the timing is difficult but I will say you've already noted in our shop we tend to use anecdotal information a lot it's somewhat mixed um housing which has tended to lead historically is actually um fairly fairly robust um travel restaurants stuff like that is fairly robust but other stuff um Trucking which has been a Guiding Light for my firms in terms of economic forecasting with a six to eight month lead time um actually since I got in the business is extremely weak we're hearing bad bad anecdotes from retail and then of course you have the you've already mentioned it</p>
<p>the the banking problem we always knew um given what I've already described there are going to be bodies out there when you have free money um people do stupid things when you have free money for 11 years people do really stupid things so there's stuff under the hood it's starting to emerge obviously the regional Banks recently we had Bed Bath and Beyond but I would assume there's a lot more bodies coming the regional Banks the median Regional Bank has 43 percent of their um loans in commercial real estate about 40 percent of that is office as you know we've had this huge change in lifestyle um due to coven number one the great resignation but number two people are going to the office so we have actually a higher vacancy rate than we had in 2008 so I put all that together</p>
<p>and I look also at the inverted yield curve the timing has always said sort of third to probably fourth quarter of this year to first quarter of 24 but the recent anecdotes the banking problems I wouldn't be surprised if the bean counters a year from now as they tend to do backward looking that the thing started sometime in the second quarter I don't know that but I do this for a living so I gotta have a forecast well thank you for that and given all the uncertainties and the difficulty of happening having an addiction what is a hard Landing look like and we're the greatest risks and how do you best mitigate those things who the outcome the stationary or def station or a combination of the two but we spoke about this a year ago I argued that 18 trillion in Sovereign</p>
<p>credit with the negative yield and interest rates at 5 000 units low 5 000 your lows was a really deflationary extreme on the other hand for years you've argued that the surest way to create deflation is to build an asset bubble and then burst it and we're the fourth grade Super Bubble of the last 100 years so how does this end and what are the implications of another round of massive monitored statements well the easy answer to your question and the most truthful one is I don't know um but I'll give it a shot first of all when I talk about a hard Landing I'm talking about something albeit starting from near record margins it probably encompasses a say a 20 to 20 percent plus with an emphasis on the plus decline in corporate profits um unemployment</p>
<p>probably going up from the 3.4 right now to something above five um probably a number of increases in bankruptcies which as you know Carol are astonishingly low given that we've been in one of the most disruptive economic periods since the 1880s and until recently there have been basically no bankruptcies and they're nowhere near where they were in 2008 um in terms of inflation or deflation wow that is really hard um two years ago I was pretty confident inflation was going to go up and go up materially now it's funny uh we had a staff meeting last week and I said I could make a case in three years for inflation being an eight or I can make a case for deflation that's kind of a</p>
<p>that's kind of a wide range in terms of giving an answer but I would say um the hardest thing looking at all this is sort of looking at the money supply so edheim and who have unbelievable respect for has pointed out that we have the most rapid shrinkage in the money supply we've ever had but it's not that simple because the money supply grew in the high 30s around 40 percent a few years ago so if you look at the stock of money it's still extremely high so if you make this big mountain and you just come down a little like this um yes the year to year over change in the money supply is like minus six percent but there's still a lot of liquidity out there I think Jamie dimon said a year and a half ago there was like two and a half trillion in excess deposits uh and savings</p>
<p>uh we've worked probably a trillion a trillion and a half of that out but there's still a stock out there so trying to time this is difficult but putting it all together giving anecdotes given the fact that we are on our way with long and variable lags we're already a year into it I would guess inflation will probably come down into the three three and a half percent range in the next six to nine months and that's when it gets really hard because then you're asking me to predict what the FED will do and I just told you I was astonished at what the FED response was in 2000 and um 21 and even in early 2022 and in case no one knows next year is an election year if they act like Arthur burns when it goes down to three or three and a half percent and you haven't had enough time where inflation is down and they don't and they haven't slayed the dragon that's where I could see a few years out</p>
<p>sort of an inflationary probably with an emphasis on the Stag part A stagflationary environment um or I am haunted by the previous things I've said and the fact that we've had this massive asset bubble if you burst it um there's a possibility that they can't put Humpty Dumpty back together again if there's one thing about the consensus that I'd say I'm on the other side of and I want to be careful with my words here um it's this constant repeating that this looks like nothing like 2008 or 2007. first of all those saying it I don't remember them predicting in 2007 what was ahead of them and I don't remember people saying the banking system was that week going in um I I am not predicting something worse than</p>
<p>2008 so I don't want to see headlines tomorrow that I said something worse in 2008 is coming but I think it's naive to not be open-minded to some sort of possibility that affect the the banks have got themselves in a balance sheet problem um before the loan losses have started because of um obviously the mismatch of liabilities and assets with treasuries on their balance sheet they're basically have stuff yielding two two and a half percent that their cost of funds is five percent on so before we even get into an economic attraction many of the banks already have impaired balance sheets if you pile on um losses in commercial real estate credit card losses the stuff that normally happens in recessions and you take the fact that we have had this big asset bubble going into it and you take the fact that we just had the most rapid increase in interest rates</p>
<p>from the bottom in in history I think it's just naive not be open-minded to something really really bad happening again it is not my forecast but as a risk manager it has to be part of my Matrix and my equation and thinking about it absolutely well let's let's go down that train of thought in a hard Landing what asset classes would perform best and of course during the uh the time of nifty fifty seventies as the uh that bubble burst in 72-74. this so-called basic industry stocks went flat didn't get anything wrong and once the FED started cutting and cutting you know in 75 they uh the absolutely soared likewise during the early 2000s the internet Bubble Burst Commodities and commodity equities especially oil held up well and of course we're the leaders in ensuing decades so the natural inclination is to</p>
<p>reduce exposure to Commodities if a hard landing were coming but history shows that that doesn't always work so as you're doing you're thinking board how do you evaluate how much exposure to happen in these sectors and what events or Market action would make you want to take a very large position well you notice the period you went right to was the period I just also mentioned which was the arthur Burns ring and with the OPEC increase in 1973 and I think oil went up 400 percent and then Burns taking his foot off the brakes too early obviously chemicals oils stuff like that and it's sort of a wonderful period I don't think this is all that different again it's going to depend a lot on government and policy makers response if we get a hard Landing but</p>
<p>one would think coming out of it um they're going to be some great Commodities copper is in the tightest position well frankly I've ever even studied I'm actually afraid to have a meaningful position in it at this point as we approach the hard Landing um only because I'm not an idiot and I know what what happened to the cyclical factors as a hard Landing starts but coming out of it um given the move toward EVS um given the usefulness of it and infrastructure spending which I think a lot of government policies will try and encourage on their way out um it's hard to believe copper won't be a huge beneficiary the question is um when I was when am I supposed to buy it and how big is the exposure and a lot of how big I would get a position like</p>
<p>that again will be policy makers response if we even get a hard Landing this isn't a four conclusion as I said earlier this is not an easy forecast place to forecast the other interesting place um is the U.S Housing Industry because housing has obviously gone down dramatically um given the 500 basis point increase in interest rates but we unlike 0.708 we actually have a structural shortage in single handling single-family homes going into this so if things got bad enough I could actually see housing which is about the last thing you would you would think of intuitively could be a big beneficiary on the way out and then um I would say there's always growth and this is really hard to figure out which names but biotech has been a big</p>
<p>underperformer in the last three to five years and there are tremendous things going on in cancer and other areas there's an article um I guess it was in The Economist uh last weekend about um new viral drugs using viruses to conquer bacteria so that would be a fruitful area and then of course there's AI um I would hope that I haven't been one to buy into fads historically I I played some Bitcoin at the bottom but never really got too too worked up about blockchain um I did I did buy the top and uh 2000 um in an emotional moment in in the tech bubble after having sold it but um I actually think um yeah I think is very very real real and could be every bit as impactful as the internet literally</p>
<p>um going forward and it could be a beautiful opportunity in a hard Landing just like oh 102 were a beautiful opportunity when the tech Bubble Burst going forward for companies who benefit from the internet um AI could be there it's funny um my firm has only been able to participate in AI by owning Nvidia and Microsoft and it's not even clear to me and this is kind of this is kind of out there Carol but it's not even clear to me if we had a really bad recession that Nvidia would even go down um it's kind of a stupid statement um given giving them multiple on it but if they bought Staples historically in recessions why wouldn't they grow a company that's obvious by a company that's obviously going to grow very rapidly so those are just some interesting thoughts I mean we own</p>
<p>we own gold and silver right now they historically have not done well in hard Landings but given the the it looks to me like the monetary and the fiscal authorities are kind of at the end of their rope and given the fact that other countries have decided particularly autographies not to hold their reserves in dollars um I'm betting for the time being uh against the history of the performance of gold and hard Landings um could be wrong and then don't go out and buy gold I could change my mind in a week or two folks but um those are just some thoughts to it to a very hard question I would say the most important answer I give that is keep an open mind and see how the authorities react to this over the six to nine months because they could give you very different outcomes but be open-minded to your question</p>
<p>we're given the the boom bus that the fat has created for decades the free money of the last decade the excessive postcoded period and now the risk of a hard Landing if one were to uh do you think the independence of the FED is in jeopardy and would it be a fatal bloat utility case for simple facts you asked really hard questions Carol um I think the fed's independence Will Survive uh I will say it'll be the most risk of that Independence um that I will have seen in 50 years so it's not a slam dunk I think there's a five to ten percent chance if the hard</p>
<p>lending got really bad and people looked back at the record of the fed the last five or ten years you already hear people screaming about 500 basis points and the FED has gone too far and what are they doing um and this is with unemployment at 3.4 percent 2024 an election year um if things get really bad and they look at the actual record the guy blew 40 Years of credibility in terms of disinflationary mindset and then like a reformed smoker Maybe if we have a hard Landing people say he over adjusted and was wrong again it's going to come under attack I hope and believe their independence Will Survive but it's not an unreasonable question I believe certainly isn't moving on to</p>
<p>what the government will do in a recession in terms of of stimulus is it possible that we've seen literally the end of the credit cycle and then no more balance sheets left too right it's possible but these guys never cease to amaze me yeah um I don't think they'll go down without a fight we have we come into this with fiscal challenges completely unlike any time we've ever been in this situation before I remember um in 79 and 80 when Reagan wrote in on his white horse you know the market was eight times earnings um prices were depressed and balance sheets particularly the governments were nowhere near in the situation they're in now so there's</p>
<p>there's not the room to move in on the monetary or the fiscal front in a reasonable manner that there's been going into other Cycles we basically wasted all our bullets amazingly in the last few years in in an economic expansion um but you know the government can always print money and try look at look at what they did in Japan I mean they tried everything and it didn't work uh the question is are we there the answer is I hope not going back to Edward Chancellor and you were kind enough to with Scott Besson here in my Branch West in January and you asked the question uh who's our current Society so addicted to government and Central Bank and asked him that it's impossible to work our way way out of this</p>
<p>and you asked Edward when you thought it was when past the point of no return and he said he thought we had what do you think I would never just categorically say we pass a point in no return but you know I was worried about our fiscal situation so worried about it that 12 years ago I went out and tried to convince young people on a college tour of what lay ahead of us and was worried about the 2025 to 3035 period because of the demographics of the situation and what might happen with interest expense um frankly um the period since then has been worse than I ever imagined so um I don't want to go quite so far as Edward went but let me just say I'm concerned I don't</p>
<p>know I'm concerned I it is amazing how America has this culture that always seems to respond and come back and maybe with a hard landing and a flush out and just a terrible recession that brings back the values and the culture we've all had we come out of this on the other side but I mean it's a it's a it's a scary cocktail that we're being presented with yeah yeah I know so looking at how you navigate these tricky markets and you've been saying for a year that being short is very dangerous because of these brutal bear Market ballots but if you're a standard in long short hedge fund how do you position yourself oh Carol I like um I like concentrated bets I like fat</p>
<p>pitches and then the swing big and I also like when you don't see a fat pitch stand there and let the pitches go by um two years ago two years at 15 basis points with a money growing at 40 percent money supply growing at 40 percent that was a fat pitch um your risk reward was maybe if you're dead wrong the two-year yield goes from 15 basis points to 10 basis points I thought at the time if I was right they would go to 200 I have to admit I didn't think they were going to go to 500 in a year I didn't think the FED had it in them um I don't see a pitch like that out there right now I was also very negative on the stock market um and I'm not positive on the stock market but we've come a long way I'm afraid of the authorities um</p>
<p>and if I like the stock market you know I would be exposed and I'm not exposed to it so my advice would be to a long short hedge fund keep your gross low be open-minded and if we get a hard Landing um there are going to be unbelievable opportunities and I don't want to miss those opportunities by blowing my money now and having some 20 or 30 percent loss where my head is all screwed up when those opportunities presents himself so I'm happy um with with a with a portfolio right now that is not net short or not in that long and only about 60 percent gross because funny things happen when you need chaos you know the The Playbook I've always used if I expected a bad economic outcome is to own treasuries well with with 10-year yielding 350 or</p>
<p>wherever it is today um and fed funds at five that's not exactly a fat pitch what if you're wrong um and what if what if the FED panics can you get an inflationary outcome so that asset class is sort of off the table um we can talk about the dollar in a few minutes I don't have some massive short dollar position I may have been a little misinterpreted uh in an interview I did a week ago but I but it is a position that will move the needle at my firm uh I don't know how long I'm going to stick with it but that that is something we're doing but for for long short guys out there I would say you're going to have unbelievable opportunities in the next couple years there's a lot of dispersion um within Industries and just make sure just make sure to preserve your Capital until they present themselves and I wouldn't go crazy on the short side for</p>
<p>that reason either but I said so let's come back to a point you raised earlier and go into more detail on it and that's the U.S fiscal situation so the first quarter of this year we saw the third largest deficit in history uh exceeded only by the coveted quarter and and TFC and what happens in a recession or hard Landing can be deficit and the U.S didn't extend the Charities would have had a chance and now uh interest uh federal debt is running out of 600 billion annual rate even during 2018 when unemployment hit a 50-year low the deficit never even fell below five percent and then in the post-coded boom which you referred to as being something you've never seen before the US government ran a deficit of over a trillion and never in history has a boom economy produced the worst physical result</p>
<p>there's a lot of talk about the destiny but you're concerned for years has been next ability of this entitled expense and by some estimates the present value of undefined government liabilities is its highest 200 trillion and one CEO study shows that entitlements plus net interest will cost 100 of taxes in 2040. so we've all out your thinking on this which you've been talking about for a long time well first of all the the debt ceiling debate is is really depressing um look I hope um we don't have a technical default I think it would be stupid I think it would be a market event I think it would be a problem but it's just amazing all the catastrophic forecasts</p>
<p>from government officials and others and the focus on the on the debt ceiling um I gave a speech at USC last week and I said all this talk about the debt ceiling is like sitting on the Santa Monica Pier and you've got a 30-foot wave coming in and you're worried about the Santa Monica Pier being damaged um but you know 10 miles out is a 200 foot tsunami um and that's kind of the situation here and to some extent it's it's discouraging that the Republicans have given the Biden Administration the debt ceiling to even talk about because it enables them to talk about a responsibility and the real problem is not the debt ceiling is a market event it wouldn't be it wouldn't be pleasant it would be stupid but the other thing is an existential a threat to American</p>
<p>capitalism you just mentioned in 2040 that's not that far away folks I mean think back 17 years 2006 doesn't seem that long ago that's that's 2040 and in 2040 um entitlements plus centers expense using CBO estimates which I think are ridiculously low on interest rates if we're in that situation um are greater than that's when they cross become greater than taxes in 2052 just 30 years using their projections it's a taxes it's 117 percent of taxes and we have an 11 deficit assuming a four percent interest rate will give if you have that situation interest rates aren't going to be four so the most annoying thing is probably the Republicans caving in which they probably needed to if they</p>
<p>want to keep their jobs on the entitlements look Jesse James why do you rob the bank's webs where the money is there's no money except entitlements that's where it is we are absolutely going to cut entitlements in this country it is a lie and it is a fantasy to say we don't have to cut entitlements the problem is we're either going to cut them now or we're going to cut them later but if we cut them later because we will have waited the interest expense which is already set under CBO to go from 8 to 27 percent of GDP will go much much higher um so it's a choice and I don't think it's a hard one because they say how bad it would be for current seniors if we were to do something entitlement well what about future seniors why should current seniors get a dollar or 100 of a loaf and future seniors get zero it makes no sense to me and until we deal with this it's going to squeeze out everything else it's</p>
<p>going to squeeze out government investment is going to squeeze out private investment uh and is going to have terrible Economic Consequences and it's just extremely disheartening to watch well Washington macaron trying to resolve it and paying he's going through his Harbinger well that's that's macronas that's quite interesting and I learned something when I was doing the uh preparing the speech for USC because I knew we were in bad shape the economists have something they call the fiscal Gap that's the amount you would have to raise taxes today to maintain the generosity that you've promised futures future seniors um and in the United States that's 7.7 of GDP what does that mean that means if you wanted to fix this situation today without touching entitlements you'd have</p>
<p>to raise taxes 40 tomorrow morning and keep the mayor forever or cut spending tomorrow morning by 35 percent keep the mirror forever although of course it's worse than that um because that would cause the economy to go down and actually tax revenues go down blah blah blah what was astonishing to me is our fiscal Gap is 7.7 percent France France the poster child for social welfare and all that stuff their fiscal Gap is 2.4 percent so it's less than a third of ours and they're addressing the problem it's just it's frankly amazing really it's lack of leadership so this obviously leads us to ask about the dollar which you referred to and the dollar could certainly fall 25 percent to reach equilibrium but there are other factors that could</p>
<p>make it worse after the freezing of Russian foreign exchange Reserves there's been steady liquidation of barn Central Bank holdings even France has reduced its treasury by 25 since March last year the weaponization of the U.S dollar is having dramatic consequences and now you have the possibility that China could continue to grow while the U.S is in a hard Landing and this this brings me to one of your favorite themes and that's the curse of the reserve currency so please give me your your outlook for the dollar given everything we were talking about and explain what you mean by the curse of the reserve currency well I think most of the audience has heard of the resource course if you have um oil or some great metal onto the ground</p>
<p>the population doesn't have to work very hard and there's not a lot of innovation um going on so the economy never really innovates and grows dramatically and does the right thing the the best um probably way to explain the resource course is to take the opposite and that's Israel they have no resources they've dramatically outperformed the rest of the Middle East who has all the resources um the reserve currency is an unbelievable privilege and unfortunately that privilege while you have it allows you if you choose to do so to run very myopic policies that don't address the long-term and allows you to behave in a way because markets don't check you because you're being funded by outside sources</p>
<p>everything we just described um the fiscal recklessness the monetary recklessness all that no other country could have pulled that off and it's fun and it's great while it lasts but it enables you to keep digging and digging and digging into a deeper hole until [Music] um the consequences come to bear and ironically it probably to some extent you do it enough you lose the privilege and then you only have the consequences so that's why I call it the curse of the reserve currency when Britain um tried to do fiscal stimulus with with mistrust um the market immediately shut them down and they immediately went to a more responsible form of government we have no check on us well all this craziness</p>
<p>we just talked about went on in 21 and 22 the dollar actually went up any other place the market would have rejected it and we would have gotten our house in order immediately when you're the reserve currency you can continue digging your own grave until filing your debt and you're under the soil the things that disturb me the last decade was what I would call the trying to solve the problem of death with Florida of course that was done in the 20s very unsuccessful and with free money there was a massive misallocation of resources and I was very worried when I saw the pricing of borrowing or risky Borrowers at ridiculously no rights that did not reflect risk</p>
<p>and adding going back to your comment about no bankruptcies sooner or later this this has to be resolved and how do you think it is going to be resolved will the government end up supporting everything is there a limit you know whether it be winners and losers well Donna survive and some won't how do you think that that ends I don't know that is the existential question of our time um if we get in a hard Landing our we finally going to allow creative destruction and capitalism to do its thing with horrible near-term when I say near-term one to three year consequences [Music] um I think if we do we'll have a chance people will go back to work values will come back even gen Z will think maybe</p>
<p>they're supposed to work um maybe we can clean all this out and what's made America great for 200 years could possibly revive on the other hand we can go the route we've been going for the last 20 or 30 years which is try more monetary stimulus more debt sort of what Japan has done and end up in a permanent malaise we're not nearly we don't have the Firepower we had back then but I will never forget because it was right after I started Duquesne 1982. volcker intentionally threw us into a recession he raised rates to 20 percent we had a horrible recession um in 82. big increase in unemployment but you know what even politically Reagan won 49 states in 1984. we got 20 to 30 years of</p>
<p>prosperios we took the pain and we cleaned up our Act I'd never bet and say America is finished and I would like to try that I hope they try that experiment again which is not manipulate things but you know given given our political history given the divisiveness given Where We Are it's it's hard to imagine any politician having the guts guts to do that going forward and then into your earlier question if a Federal Reserve chairman tries it um particularly given the record of the last four or five years their independence could be threatened so it's um we're in a precarious moment I what came to mind as you were talking is Andrew melon's famous statement from the early 30s liquidate labor liquidate Capital urge</p>
<p>The Rock from the system and of course he was vilified for that the way things unfolded and do we have the courage to follow through he was vilified and God and depression would be a horrible price to pay um but again and I don't want a depression and I hope we don't do policies to throw you in our depression but it is funny to look back America kind of did okay after the 30s ended um and so they're they're going to be tough choices ahead and I think we all have to be open-minded and watch and and see how they go we don't even know who the president's coming in 2024 hopefully it's not going to be Donald Trump or Joe Biden all right you suggested that there's a good chance that the coming decade could be a lost decade</p>
<p>for for Equity markets and again you know we're dealing in scenarios and building possibilities but you've obviously gotten through in such a situation how can we protect our wealth yeah just because I said I expected the market to be flat same place it was in 10 years doesn't mean it'll be a lost decade for investors you could have made a lot of money um in the 68 to 82 period being long the stock market and being long the right stocks at the right time we had huge bull market rallies from 70 to 72 as you mentioned earlier you could have made a fortune in oil chemical those kind of stocks early on then we had another huge rally obviously from 75 up to the 77 period so even if we were</p>
<p>flat for the next 10 years there'll be opportunities I have no doubt unfortunately I'm not smart enough to identify them but I have no doubt there will be applications made on top of the model builders in AI where you'll have 100 billion dollar companies emerge and who knows with with all the dark talk we've had which is more than I think either of us would have liked to last 40 or 45 minutes um AI could be as impactful productivity wise as the PC was for all the technology we've had so much of it has gone into social networks and other things that have not enhanced productivity um there there are some hopes there but when I look at marketed 20 times earnings when I look at margins as high as they are when I look at the fiscal challenges I just pointed out and the squeezing of private investment um I was asked a question and I answered it it's it's it's hard for me to Envision stocks being higher in 10 years and I</p>
<p>think it was in response so I kept Washington TV and everybody was embarrassed and said but I'm bullish for the long term I just don't want people to go and buy and hold and and think they're going to make nine percent a year in the next 10 years I've been wrong before they might but that's not that's not my expectation he told me when we spoke a week or so ago that MBs is the most popular leader in the Middle East and the people actually not him I have to confess that it was a surprise to me and what do you think the significance of this is for the Middle East and geopolitics in general well I just think our Administration has made him a terrible mistake isolating the sky um he's 37 years old he's wildly popular not just in Saudi Arabia but in the Middle East he's a he's a dynamic dynamic leader and</p>
<p>it appears to me and this is more gas analysis he's trying to make himself a hegemony in in the Middle East um I noticed he brought the president of Egypt in met him at the airport done a deal with Iran he's sort of building this autocratic block within the Middle East and I think he's probably going to succeed um so I just think we've made a huge mistake frankly I think his um discouragement is not so much toward the U.S as the Biden Administration and if we get the Right leader I think this can be repaired underlining think um as opposed to know it can be repaired so depending on who the president is in 24 I think we can get this back but I think it's imperative we get this back this guy's going to be in power for 40 or 50</p>
<p>years obviously we have an energy transition no matter what you think about climate there's a bridge of at least 10 to 15 years and we don't want him to be in bed with China and not in bed with us I just think it's a disaster given the whole geopolitical outlook looking forward well let's uh let's uh move on to happier subjects and some personal questions to finish up here [Music] you and your wife you want to raise three extraordinary daughters despite enormous family well and how did you manage it and what's the advice you have for others because they're not in time but how do you best transfer wealth to the next generation without generating entitlement in the loss of the drive to succeed I managed it</p>
<p>with ridiculous luck um I married someone who I was in love with and I knew she was very intelligent and had great values but I had no idea what a great mother she would be and um I've always told young people in terms of parenting forget quality time it's quantity time all time with your children is quality time there's no such thing just like you can just do quality it's it's funny because my wife and I had a very different view um in terms of how to how to handle our wealth in the kids um she she didn't say no a whole lot and I thought she was crazy but in terms of the household she was the boss and you're right We've Ended up with three very happy overachieving grounded children I think</p>
<p>she gave up her job and made her job being that raising the children home and put such effort into it and spent so much time with them I tried to spend the time with him I could and I think rather than preaching to them they just observed our behavior and our values and they ended up being great kids but I'd say I had about three percent to do that and Fiona had 97 to do with it so there was a lot of luck involved but if you're only as happy as your least happy child uh I'm very very lucky there they are well people in our business tend to be very focused and driven but I wouldn't say many of them are happy but you're a happy man you've got this Balanced Life you're one of the great philanthropists in America you have a beautifully evolved spiritual</p>
<p>wife who you love these three lovely daughters all successful and you have this balance and yet you achieved this phenomenal performance and you're a happy man how do you do it I don't know Carol I've just been very fortunate I've lived the American dream um my mother-in-law says I'm idiots Savannah I agree with her I don't know why I just happen to be good at compounding money I love the business I love the intellectual stimulation of knowing every event in the world changes some security price somewhere and trying to figure out the puzzle so if it works 60 or 70 hours a week and you love your job there's so many hours right there um we don't do we're somewhat anti-social so we don't spend a lot of time doing that stuff which leaves time uh to</p>
<p>to be with our family and do do Leisure not not associated with going out to dinners and Society events and stuff like that yeah the philanthropy um is just a source of great joy and I consider it a privilege that we have the money to do it I don't think it's something we should be thanked for I I like to say I like to thank the grantees because they're giving us the joy of funding them and they're the do-gooders out there change the world so look given the wife I've lived and living the American dream if I wasn't happy I that would be bizarre to me so I've just had an extremely lucky life yeah it's wonderful to hear stance I need to do it and the last question is your philanthropy obviously you have your fingers in many different pies many different things are going on what are you most excited about and what's most interesting in the space</p>
<p>well as you know there's a few things but as you know um I had the great Fortune meeting Jeff Canada back in the early 90s and he basically was the father of I would say the the place matters thing that Raj Chetty um subsequently proved with Statistics but that if you can change your neighborhood you can clear out some of these pockets in America where kids don't have a shot at the American dream um because of the success of the Harlem Children's Home and because we have a great leader there now young leader Jeff has actually come back to work after retiring and he's helping roll this out nationally so through blue Meridian partners um and I would say because George Floyd combined with coven kind of shined a light on on the plight of disadvantaged neighborhoods there's just tremendous new interest from new funders in in the place matter space play Space</p>
<p>models so that's something uh I'm tremendously excited about sort of taking the Harlem children's own model finding leaders in other challenge cities and changing them so economic Mobility the other one um is just cancer I've been on the board of Sloan Kettering Memorial Sloan Kettering for I think 27 or 28 years the first 10 or 15 years we were poisoning people with chemotherapy and hoping it would kill the cancer before it killed then then about 14 years ago they sort of figured it out mutations personalized medicine there just wasn't one lung cancer there were hundreds of them uh immunotherapy basically they cracked the code and the cancer therapies are going like this if you're on an s-curve we're we're cider right right here the lung cancer center we funded there in 2014 the the outcomes of survivals over five years for 14 they're now 58</p>
<p>and that's sort of just what's going on throughout cancer so that's really really an exciting area to see an area that um we're hoping for the same kind of results but it hasn't happened yet as it is in the neuroscience and neurology place there we funded a lot of basic um basic research and we don't have the results of the cancer I'm hoping we're 10 or 15 years behind it but I do think the brain will sort of Be the Last Frontier and you only get Success Through failures and we're finding out over and over again what doesn't work but I'm pretty sure they'll figure it out and then the last thing is the is the environment uh that that's a big bucket for us and um there's a lot of money going into uh climate uh and other things I would I would just say there I've been very disappointed that it's sort of a top-down command and control model and</p>
<p>why we're not doing a carbon tax and forgetting all this government intervention and just letting the market handle it it's been a big disappointment but those are our three big buckets are our economic Mobility which obviously really is affected by education um to health and then through the environment that's very inspirational when you continue to do so many good things with so many people I'm very grateful for having healthy and happy and change and good work well I think that wraps it up for today and thank you so much for Carol it's always great to see you I I love talking to you but your questions are a little too hard but uh it makes it more fun in some ways [Music] thanks for thank you thanks a lot have a good day you too</p>
