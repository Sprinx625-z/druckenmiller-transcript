<p>Stan we have been um discussing in Oslo inflation energy AI chips geopolitics and so on so when you put your investing hat on what's at the top of your mind the top of my mind first of all it's good to see you Nikolai the the I would guess the top of my mind is just how uncertain for me trying to analyze the environment is going forward I've been doing this for 45 years I've studied a lot of economic history but I've never had a situation where you had free money for 11 years a very broad asset bubble followed by jacking up rates 500 basis points in 12 months so for someone like me who likes to look at history and come up with potential scenarios this is a particularly difficult period</p>
<p>two years ago wasn't so difficult when you had two years at 15 basis points and money's probably growing at 30. it didn't take a genius to figure out that was a good risk reward um these days things are a lot more complicated but you just mentioned about everything on our mind the generative AI inflation is on our mind acid bubbles currencies all the stuff we usually think about so how do you navigate it then uh well luckily I don't have any clients so I don't have uh I don't well you see I have I have one client and it's pretty big it's really big um I don't have to I don't feel performance pressure um so historically I deal in five or six</p>
<p>asset buckets tends to keep me out of trouble in terms of playing in an area where I shouldn't be playing at a particular time and I think it's one of the most important things to do is not to play when you when you don't see a fat pitch I don't see a fat pitch in fixing comes extremely complicated because I'm I'm in the hard Landing camp um probably sometime later this year but again this is so complicated I'm not willing to place a big bed and even if I believe in a hard Landing which I do what do you do with two-year treasuries and a sub four percent with funds at five and a quarter I better be right of my hard Landing if I want to own fixed income and then in the long run um historically this is easy if I</p>
<p>believe we're hard Landing I'm supposed to own bonds but they're not exactly a screaming bargain 10 years at three and a half in in the U.S particularly with a Fed that has certainly shown some metal in the last year but historically I wouldn't say Jerome Powell is a profiling courage so if we get into hard landing and he moves aggressively I could see bonds and inflation coming back with a Vigor from what I expect to be a lower level than right now I will say that the the response to Silicon Valley a nerve May a little because in four days they print enough money they basically wiped out the entire reduction of the balance sheet they had done for five or six months so if I'm trying to look ahead and anticipate I don't have a lot of faith in these guys should we get into a hard Landing</p>
<p>that they're going to hold the line and not do something maybe worse than Arthur Burns and and where does it leave equities I think within the equity Market if if put a gun in my head I'd be sure the economy to the extent I should something pure like Russell 2000 obviously I don't want to go into individual short names but names um like that old economy economically sensitive stuff but let's just say we're gonna have a hard landing and a bad recession in the U.S what does that mean for NVIDIA I don't know I mean oils and and chemicals went up in 73 and 74. Staples have gone up in bad recessions in the U.S historically what do I do if with a company if you have a bad recession in the U.S but it's</p>
<p>growing wildly throughout that period because we have an arms rates going on in its space it's not clear to me it goes down so I think the equities are complicated I mean I'd say the one area that whether I I feel reasonably comfortable in is I'm sure the United States dollar currency Trends tend to run at least two or three years we had a long one here over 10 trillion something like 13 trillion came into the US dollar during the previous decade I will say full disclosure I missed the dollar probably the biggest Miss in my career and in currency trades I missed the last nine months run up in the dollar I just couldn't bring myself down Joe Biden and Jerome Powell but um on a relative basis the tightening in the U.S going forward</p>
<p>will not be as much as as the foreigners now that we've weaponized the dollar and you've got people like Google uh running around asking why we need to be trading in US Dollars by the way it's not a bad question historically we could be trusted we had a rule of law a lot of things so about the only space I have any risk on right now it's it's in the US dollar um don't run out in short dogs I could change my mind in a week but that's where I am right now and I'm also on gold obviously for the same reasons but just uh just to come back to this so you say you haven't seen it as problematic for 45 years and it's really complicated and so on so what do you do then you're sitting cash or no I'm too I'd like to I'd like to say I had I'm still in cash but I'm too much of a junkie I'm always doing something I I'd say uh our equities were about</p>
<p>three percent net short which is nothing but again I've got there's always equities we like versus other equities our fixed income position is minimal except in jgbs where I don't know whether I'm getting it paid or not but I think the risk reward is is ridiculous it reminds me a little just a little of the two-year two years ago they have an inflation problem but again I'm dealing on government action so it's not cash we got stuff going on but uh I'd say my p l doesn't move generally more than 30 or 40 basis points a day that's how button down I have what I'll call our Matrix here our Matrix being the buckets I talked about and the investment within those buckets yeah well you'd be pleased to hear that I'm I'm joined by roughly 200 junkies here in Oslo uh who also think it's difficult to not do much now</p>
<p>tomorrow we're releasing a podcast with Steven Schwartzman from Blackstone and he has one of his 25 rules not to lose money and so I mentioned him I said isn't that a bit of a lame advice it's a bit obvious but you are kind of in the same camp aren't you I mean I think you never had a down year and you are a pretty uh super keen on not losing money why is that so important I mean again again it's a lame question right but it's actually not that lame but uh let's listen to you it's just mathematics um if you go down 50 you got to go back 100 to get it back to even and I've always thought the way to build a long-term track record is when you really see the ball swing really big and when you don't see the ball don't swing and if you can build a record and when you're terrible years you're up zero to five and then throw a couple 50s and 60s</p>
<p>in the numbers look pretty good over time if you make if you make a bunch of uh 30s and then you lose 55 or 60 percent you got a long long way back and it's just the way the numbers worked then also I'm a sore loser I don't like to lose so that kind of helps out too just remind us of your compounding well when I had clients which is the only audited record it was uh just a little bit over 30 percent net a year for 30 years yeah well that's that's that's pretty good but again the top here was 99.99 I had a lot of uh I had a lot of five and sevens in there I didn't like like 20 30 every year it was a matter of never losing and then throwing some big numbers in there maybe 10 times</p>
<p>yeah well that sounds like a plan for the fun here as well um now um [Laughter] um tell us how do you um uh when you invest how important is the analysis and how much is now gut feel or pattern recognition yeah um I don't know who but I heard a saying with analysis comes paralysis and uh or Soros used to say invest and then investigate which I was already doing before I met him but uh it's more important now even than it was then we're in such a fast-moving world with all the new Communications that if I get an idea and I think it's attractive and for whatever reason that security price will be higher in a year or two um I generally go ahead and buy it and then tell the analysts to book into it</p>
<p>and if it turns out I was wrong after they analyze it I get out I I don't like to wait around I've a lot of my best ideas I'm not that smart so if I if I see it whatever's going on to cause that idea to happen someone else might see it and by the time we get done analyzing I will miss 30 or 40 of the move and then I'm paralyzed because it just went up 30 or 40 percent and I don't have the guts to buy it even if I think it's going higher we're more in the camp of if if we got a strong feeling we'll cut the analysis short and then then by all means do our analysis thoroughly and then just unload it if it turned out my my thesis was wrong do you depend more on on this type of pattern recognition than you did in your early days no I I started in the 70s and my mentor</p>
<p>turned out to be a chartist um I still use that a to find to find things others may not be looking at because we use rate of change stuff that tends to lead and B it's if I do take a big position it's a great check on me not falling in love with security or falling in love with my idea to have those to have those charts as part of this discipline he used to say um if there's six thousand uh well I don't know whether politically correct would say if there's six thousand girls out there you can date you can always find 20 that have a good chart and a good fundamental story so if either if either one didn't fit um I wouldn't do it so that the technical provides a discipline on the fundamental and the fundamental divide provides a discipline on the technical</p>
<p>now I believe um that one of the Hallmarks of a great investor is to have to be stubborn but at the same time agile and being able to change your mind then you have that incredible combination now how do you question your own beliefs price action is important I try to have young people around me who are not afraid to speak their mind to me and argue with me uh if somebody's here too long and they agree with everything I say they're not here that much longer because you know I need healthy debate but you know we're constantly following the news we're following the fundamentals and also the price action I will say since the Algos and everybody got involved in Factor investing and whatever's going on these days um price action is not what it used to be 20 or 30 years ago 20 30 years ago if a company reported a horrible result</p>
<p>and it opened down say 10 and ended up on the day you could almost guarantee that stock was going to be higher in three months it's not the case anymore everybody seems to know these tricks I've seen that action and then a month later this the Stock's right back down again so part a big part of my process which is price action versus news I obviously still watch it if I've got a thesis and it's really bullish and it's playing out and the Stock's not going anywhere makes me go back and check the thesis over and over but price action versus news is not is not what it used to be 20 or 30 years ago probably because the competition has learned the same game whereas when I got in the business you didn't have that many people that had it that bigger part of their process so you set the passive passive Capital going into the ETFs or is it actually the you know the AI algo Traders and so on</p>
<p>I don't think it's so much the passive I think it's very active hedge funds that learned the the same stuff doing it and obviously these these Factor investors and Algos and quants definitely they they'll really mess up um what used to be historical price action versus news and its message a lot of people in my position have complained about them I you know to me it's just a new world and I got to deal with people got to deal with me I might as well have to deal with them very good so um lastly Stan if you were to leave us with some good advice here how are we going to make the most money for the next two years oh boys um you know I I said something that the Press ran with I don't know eight months ago maybe it was a year ago that um</p>
<p>I would be I wouldn't be surprised if if the stock market was not higher in 10 years I still believe that but I do think like the 68 to um 82 period will have some big swings so I think the way to make money the next two years in the equity space is to be patient because I I do think we have possibly some rough roads ahead and I do think the central bank will respond in some crazy way that will give you a period like 70 to 72 where you can make money or 76 to 78 when you could have made a lot of money and also for me at least uh I think the currency markets are very interesting but I think this is a movie I've I've never seen anything like it so I'm I'm going to be very careful not</p>
<p>to dig myself in a hole when I don't have a strong belief to come out because I think the opportunities are going to be amazing as this movie unfolds in the next year in macro and inequities great I think that's a fantastic um place to end it ties in what we heard here today that the world is changing we've never seen it before it's um a shift it's a paradigm shift uh we're going kind of through a new door we are in a bit of a vacuum so uh big thanks for sharing your thoughts with us today thank you [Applause]</p>
