<p>hi everyone uh thanks for being with us today we um it is a really unique privilege to be hosting one of the world's greatest investors and having the opportunity to gain his insights on risk and trading our guest began his career in markets at the pittsburgh national bank of all places uh and he began in equity research in 1981 he left the bank and started duquesne capital based in pittsburgh and after a few years he left and started his own firm called duquesne capital a few years into running duquesne he was hired by dreyfuss and he only went there on the condition he could continue to run duquesne and then in 1988 he went to george to work for soros working with george soros and running his quantum macro fund while stan was there the fund grew to 20 billion dollars in assets and throughout his time both at soros anna dreyfus he continued to run</p>
<p>duquesne management here's some facts on duquesne duquesne has never had a losing year and it was founded in 1981. his assets while not disclosed to something greater than 10 billion his annual returns while not disclosed exceeds 25 per annum which by the way in the same period makes him a more successful investor than warren buffett his total staff is less than 100 people including the back office and that's what he uses to generate those returns and for us he is probably the most professional and valued client we have because his firm operates the way he does always in the most professional manner he's also an important member of the new york community he is a very active chair of the harlem children's zone he's on the boards of the environmental defense fund of memorial sloan kettering and of the</p>
<p>children's scholarship fund for me and i say this with complete sincerity it has been an utter privilege to have the ability to talk to him um most weeks for the last few years and i hope you will find that's true today as well please join me in welcoming stan druckenmiller hmm can i get a peek at the questions yeah when uh when i asked dan if he would uh if he would come do this he said so wait let me understand this all i have to do is listen to your questions and be honest with the answers and i said that's all you have to do he said fine i'll do it so let's start with uh your director of investments at a bank of tender age of 28.</p>
<p>how did you learn to trade at a bank as a head of research well i started at i get i give you a little background i started at the bank at uh 23 i dropped out of graduate school because i want to get a phd in economics it took me about a semester and a half to figure that one going to work and i got a job in construction and then the only job i could get was at pittsburgh national and i started in the training program in a bank you're a teller you go through the credit department and everybody wants to go to the credit department uh and i thought i was pretty smart there were 12 of us had a pretty high opinion of myself and i went in after we went through the training program and the guy in credit said you couldn't sell snowmobiles in alaska if there was uh no other uh transportation vehicle there</p>
<p>so we have no use for you anywhere in the bank um but but um there's a guy up on the 30th floor whose personality is worse than yours um who once who runs the trust department you know he's a great investors but um you should call him up and uh see if he'll hire you so i called the guy up and he said where'd you go to school and i said i meant university of michigan and before i got out he said if i went to michigan you're hired um so i went up there and uh i started uh as an analyst in the banking industry in the chemical industry and i'm doing that about a year and a half i think i was 25. this guy was really quirky okay and uh he got in a fight with the top management of the bank and no that was later i'm sorry so there were about eight eight guys in research</p>
<p>and i've been there about a year and a half and he promoted me to be director research which is a little crazy because everybody else had an mba they had more experience and i'd like to say it was something to do with me but i think it was just this guy wanted to show them how powerful he was that he could make the make them all report this 25 year old so they all hated me and it was sort of working out uh because this guy protected me and then he got in a fight with the guy up above him so he's gone to eastern airlines and i'm there at i guess 26 now and there's the charitable guy there's the pension guy and there's the individual guy and then there's me director research all vying for power and um this this guy that ran the thing was a lawyer and he didn't understand anything about investments but he'd sit on the investment decisions they had made a</p>
<p>decision about who was going to be director investments so the shaw of iran had just been overthrown i was 26 had more courage than brains um didn't know about diversification i said well this is pretty easy let's put 70 of our money in oil stocks and let's put 30 in defense um these guys all said well that's nuts you got to do diversification blah blah blah i said no that's what we should do and you know so um the lawyer's listening to this and he doesn't know anything and so my stock selection list went up 300 percent in two years the s p was flat bonds went down the tubes which i hated now if you asked me that question anytime in the next 10 years after i was more experienced i probably wouldn't have given that answer but that's how i became director research and this guy that mentored me even though he was quirky he was an investment genius and he was very trading oriented and</p>
<p>actually very chart oriented which was good for me because when you get promoted at the age of 26 you never really learn fun and fundamental analysis and charts are kind of quicker and easier if you want to see what's going on so actually jeff i learned from this guy because uh he knew about things like if if all the news is great and the stock's not acting well get out which is pretty simple thing that for some reason most analysts don't know he taught me more what makes stocks go up and down than analysis itself which is it's it's 90 of the function but i'd say about 10 of the people is what they focus on so if we were just to jump over to the you know the technical versus fundamentals you're making an investment decision or a trading decision how do you how do you piece the two together how much time do you spend looking at charts today okay so every night</p>
<p>at about 4 30 i get 272 charts they cover um just about every group in the stock market every commodity every currency cross i'm interested in every fixed income market around the world and they're basically daily weekly and monthly daily supposed to predict 8 to 20 days weekly 8 to 20 weeks and monthly 8 to 20 months when i make an investment decision it's usually sometimes believe it or not the idea comes from the charts but i will never invest just on a chart but if i really like a fundamental thesis and the chart stinks i won't do it there's you know my my old boss used to say in terms of socks i apologize to women in the audience there's 6 000 girls out there you know if 20 or 30 of them look great</p>
<p>i don't need to bother with the rest and you can always find at least in terms of equities 20 or 30 great fundamental stories that the chart looks good but i always assume that the market may know something and i've always had a great deal of respect for the market so i'd say 75 to 80 of my ideas come from fundamental and then they're verified by the chart but i've also found ideas from the charts and then discovered the fundamentals the the charts we use because i took a shortcut to my career as you can hear charts were a great tool for me early on because i didn't learn a lot of the fundamentals in time but i did i was introduced to all the top chart systems um throughout 20 years and we ended up buying a system and bring it internally and because it used um second derivative rate of change these things will often bottom a year to</p>
<p>a year and a half before the fundamentals so they'll give you time um to study the thesis so that's why sometimes the charts actually generate the initial idea and then go and try and find a story um before we get back to your career i just want to on the charting thing ask you about one trade you know i had lunch in in march of last year must have been a week or two after bear stearns failed and uh talking oh wait oh wait and yeah that's a bad week for me but go ahead no wonder you weren't eating much the uh and we were talking about commodities and you said look i'm as bearish as can be on the economy i don't get what's going on with commodities but my charts are telling me they're going up so i'm long every chart i now all the rest of us who were really bearish on the economy were short commodities how did you reconcile the fact that you're really bearish on the economy but you went long commodities because the charts told you to do that</p>
<p>um my recollection uh is i just saw so much liquidity that was going to be provided um worldwide that i was willing to go with the charts i do remember the reason we did fine in 08 was around may or june those charts started to look quite dodgy and we got out but i i believe at that time it was pretty obvious to me that bernanke and company eric were just going to put petal the metal after bear stern so i was willing to believe the charts in terms of commodities the um back to you so you at some point you made a decision to leave the bank and start your own fund yeah what drove that how about running six billion dollars with the best record i knew and getting paid 43 grand a year i mean these guys</p>
<p>you guys are complaining about what they're doing to you okay so most people reporting to me were making more money which i thought was a little weird my mentor had left and what really happened is i came up to new york to a dinner and uh i gave this presentation on uh gold and there was a guy at the dinner and uh he came up to me after and he said you don't sound like you're from a bank i said well i guess that's a compliment thank you apology's exciting and uh he said uh well why aren't you on your own i said well i'm 27 years old and frankly i don't have any money um and uh he said well how about if i pay you ten thousand dollars a month to talk to you you don't have to write any reports nothing i'll just pay ten thousand a month to talk to you</p>
<p>so i was 28 oh and i came up and i interviewed with uh jp morgan because i was frustrated and i thought i was great in the interview and i didn't get the job i must not be able to sell um so um he told me he paid me 10 000 a month to talk to me a couple people that knew me through the bank were giving me 900 thousand dollars to manage times one percent with no performance fee was 9 000. 129 000 that's more than i was making i figured worst case i could i could come to new york and work for a bank if i fell on my face that's how it started now after working on your own for a while at some point you switched strategy right you went from being i guess a stock picking fund the long-only fund to what today we would recognize as a macro fund actually no um because my background was economics not business and it's true my first</p>
<p>venue into at pittsburgh national analytically was stocks because i was the banking analyst and because of this guy i told you the quirky guy that mentor he was a top-down real good investor i learned about liquidity and i was very strong in bonds i didn't tell you in the meeting of a lawyer i kept telling anybody bonds weren't going to go down the tubes which they did but when i started duquesne it was 81 and i had a great first year or two because i put 50 percent of the capital in 30-year bonds which quite radical at the time because they were yielding 14 and henry kaufman said they were going to 25 and he was a guru and it was a little terrifying but so you're right i'd say it was more about when i started running money for dreyfus i started to get really more involved in currencies and bonds by by the time i had gone to soros he didn't know this he thought i was an s p guy trader but but</p>
<p>i thought i knew a lot about bonds and currencies and it was actually bonds that launched my record at duquesne not not stocks so you went to soros and obviously there's a legendary trade happen there that it's basically your trade when uh you broke the bank of england or so they say can you tell us a bit about that okay um that was just one of these anomalies in history because britain and and germany were i'd say loosely economically linked and the deutsche mark and the pound were at a fixed rate i think it was 178 and the loose economic link was fine until germany decided to reunite with east germany and this created</p>
<p>huge demand and basically the strongest economy in the world while while that was happening at the same time um the u.s banking crisis savings and loan thing was in full bloom and the uk for whatever reason even though we're on other sides of the ocean and so forth they were more correlating with our economy than with the european economy and particularly at that time the german economy so they were going into a housing recession while germany was first taking off from the reunification so you had one economy tanking the other economy going like this one requiring lower rates the bundesbank was going crazy threatening politicians and everything just raising rates continually and they had a very strong currency so the pound was getting dragged up with it so i watched this for a while</p>
<p>and i was really screwed because i didn't have a chart it was just a fixed exchange rate so i couldn't cheat the way i usually do is look at look at my momentum curves but in august of that year um i looked and the six-month forwards were a half a percent well i figured it was a little bit of a long shot that i would win but if i did win it would be twenty percent it was a half a percent so we were managing 6 billion at the time so i did a billion and a half and just decided to sort of watch it so then um two weeks before the pound happened i got a call from a consultant in washington that the the germans weren't pleased at all with the italians and uh we did some lyra and that worked out um and then you know i was just going along and the forwards were starting to move a little but it was it</p>
<p>was nothing dramatic at all and it was simple as i opened up the newspaper one morning and this guy schlesinger who's head of the bundesbank at the time has written an article basically announcing that it's just totally inappropriate for the for the pound if you read it you know how one learns to read central bank it's just totally inappropriate for these bozos to be linked to the great deutsche mark so i read it again because i couldn't believe my own eyes it was in the financial times so i decided to do um five billion dollars to basically with the one and a half take the fund fully invested short the pound so the arrangement i had with george which was not the arrangement the first six months i had there where there was no declared leader it was kind of a mess but by that time i was running the fund and he had his personal account which by the way was larger than most funds at the time um so when i was doing something</p>
<p>significant i used to just make him aware and a lot of times he he'd piggyback in the f in his personal account on what i was doing so i went into him and i said i said george i just want you to know i'm going to do 5 billion dollars worth of the pound i only think i had told him about the billion and a half i've been wandering this for a while i went through the thesis and uh you know the whole economic pitch i gave you and he goes there that's ridiculous and uh i said excuse me uh george this is this is like this is like a layup he says exactly the point why are you only doing five billion dollars so he says this is a one-way this is a one-way bet that's not the way you know you manage risk you should do 15 billion dollars um because the forwards are still like half to three quarter of a percent that whole diversification lesson you learned is out the window now</p>
<p>diversification is over very overweight we can talk about it later but anyway so you know i decided uh he was right and and that this was kind of a once-in-a-lifetime thing and it was the same day it was like two or three in the afternoon so i called city and a few other banks and we started and like went to bed had given those of you who know my traitor then he's still my traitor the infamous steve oaken um we got a guy back there who uh does a great imitation if you want to see it later i i'd love to see it and if you if you call on them my condolences but anyway um i get a call about one in the morning that uh this thing is a mess the forwards have completely blown out you know we're not going to get where you want to be i said well how much have we done he</p>
<p>said like five or six billion and i said uh okay well where are the forwards and i said uh all right i'm going back to sleep oh you know i get up like 3 30 and i'll talk to you so got up and uh the british had raised their rates i i can't remember where they came from but they had raised them hugely to like 12 so uh at that point even though the forwards were out i knew they were finished because um their economy couldn't even handle whatever it was at the time i think it was eight or nine seven something like that but i said that you know if they're in a recession at seven 12 is going to do wonders for them so and and i knew they didn't have a political will so even with the forwards blown out we started to add even more because the fords i think were five or six or seven percent now and i knew that evaluation had to be 15 or 20. but we only got like two or three hundred million more on and all hell broke loose and then uh lorma norman lamont came out and they they went to 15</p>
<p>but it was a joke and then uh like four hours later as it was uh history now you've got this big move you know you bet on it you broke them did you take profit at that point it's very interesting because we made 62 net that year and we were only up 16 on september the 14th but i think we only made uh about 20 in the pound the answer is no um it didn't go to where it should and we waited and waited and waited and then when it got to where i thought it could go like 16 or 20 we just started slowly bleeding it out but we actually made more money on the concentric circles than we made in the pound i don't know whether i've ever disclosed this but um</p>
<p>the british guilts were down two points that morning not two ticks two points because it's a well-known theory in academia that if your currencies go down your bonds are going to go down it's a great theory everyone believes that the only problem is there's absolutely no basis for it if you look at history in fact if you looked at history you'd say the opposite except you'd be incorrect because you'd be saying you know eating ice cream causes hot weather but but generally when when a currency is very weak your bond market will go with it because it suggests the economy is weak so the gilts were down two points people are selling like crazy and we loaded up on gilts and they went up i think 33 points not ticks points in the next year we bought french motif bonds we bought british equities we bought all the things that i thought the blowing up of erm would affect and so we took our profits on the pound i think like six to eight weeks later and</p>
<p>more importantly the other stuff fed us for about a year but you ask a great question because and this is this is not something i did but this is a great trading lesson i wasn't there but oaken will tell you the story because he was and this is this is this is a great investor's name is george soros and when plaza happened in 85 he was loaded to the brink with yen like already too big and all the little traders there we didn't have this when i was running quantum but they were they had their little 25 to 50 million capital pools so they were they were allowed to piggyback so they were all long yen because frankly george was long in so the next morning after plaza the yen opened up 800 ticks and george soros is an interesting guy but i worked for him for 12 years and i never</p>
<p>heard him swear and i never saw much emotional change takes that would last with me for about four minutes if you're with me on a desk but um apparently these all these other guys started taking profits and he had an absolute heart attack stop it transfer all that stuff to me you know they're idiots and the thing you know thing went another 40 another 4 000 ticks so the easy thing emotionally was to take a profit and in fact george was adding and and taking that too because you know you can't just make yourself feel good by taking a profit when something goes your way you have to remember your original game plan your original thesis and why you thought it would go from if it's a to b wherever b is and you know so you know kind of on that theme but going the other way so people describe you as very disciplined</p>
<p>at the same time i've seen you run positions that have gone against you in a long way i think about you know the yen and the 2005 period or the rio last year or the indonesian rupiah my worst memory of my life in 96 but let's leave that one out because it won't teach the lesson you're trying to teach here actually i think we'd like to hear about it about the rupiah sure oh boy um we had a we had a bigger hit in the thai bot than we had in uh in the british pound but they lent by then certain entities within our firm that were above me had learned to stay quiet um when we had a success but um unlike the british pound the thai bot was not my idea there was a guy uh that worked with us named rodney jones</p>
<p>and he he he had worked for the bank of new zealand and he was out in asia and rodney had showed me this chart of thailand and loans to gdp had gone from some nominal amount to 150 percent he thought the whole thing could blow up put it on in february big position no no forward cost of the time and it blew up in uh july and um so we made a lot of money and we had a little bit of well not a little but we had a fair amount of malaysian ringgit so we're taking profits on the thai bot and the malaysian ringgit and uh i became convinced by someone at the firm i've conveniently forgotten who um that the washout was over now and that indonesia was different they didn't have the fundamental problems that thailand and and malaysia had turns out i had worse but um</p>
<p>i don't quite know what was going on because i think suharto was funneling money out because the the macro numbers were fine but this thing was unbelievable i mean it just kept going and going and going and i couldn't get out and to some extent i was so big relative to the size of the market i froze but i lost well over a billion dollars in it and the worst year i ever had basically flat on the year so how do you size your trades you look at how many positions do you carry at once and how do you size any one trade well i think diversification is really overrated and i'm no i really do i i'm from the school of uh if you've really got a great thesis and you've and you've analyzed the risk award put all your eggs in a couple baskets or in one basket and then watch the basket very closely um but when i was when i was at soros</p>
<p>a lot of my positions by the time we got over 10 billion particularly back then i always sized them relative to the market not to the capital of the fund so i would never get bigger i would never get so big in something that i i thought i couldn't get out where it would cost the fun maybe one or two percent in execution cost alone to get out so that was always a rule no matter how good um no matter how good the idea and and the pound thing is easy because i could have gotten out of i could have gotten out of the fixed exchange rate so that governed that um now back when i was younger and not as wealthy and probably had a lot more courage you know it's a lethal triple um i used to take my fund i'd put 150 to 200 percent of it in a currency i put 300 percent in 10-year bond equivalent</p>
<p>um equities i really rarely would get more than 100 percent net long or rarely more than 50 net short but our our gross leverage very very rarely would run more than four to one but if i really really believed something i'd have no problem putting a hundred percent of the fund in it again with the liquidity strength i meant constraint i mentioned earlier and i i will say that unlike my competitors and who knows have the right model i learned very very very very early on because i think we were the biggest at the time at least for me it's very difficult to run a hedge fund with more than 10 billion dollars effectively and being from the equity school and having learned currencies and bonds i felt i had a lot of weapons so the funds that</p>
<p>to me over 15 or 20 billion and still raising money i don't understand that and we have tried religiously to keep our assets around the 10 billion dollar level because my belief is if we let our assets blow up to 40 or 50 billion and a modestly we certainly could have any time in the last three or four years based on the record i would just have horrible performance and the assets would leave anyway so our philosophy has been to grow it organically and then when you get to 10 billion start squeezing clients out and manage your own money to try and keep it there because in the long run a i've got an ego problem so i like i like performing after a while it's not about the money you make it's about it's how you feel about yourself so that i guess i've given a very long answer to your question so let's get back to you so with indonesia it just kept going against you and you couldn't explain why and lost enough money that you were like i'm done with this</p>
<p>what about something like brazil and la where you saw it go from 180 to 240. okay so brazilian 08 i think somebody gave you the wrong information because i had a problem with brazilian but it's instructive um i brought i brought bought brazil i think above 250 you know for and had held it for quite a while and as those of you know brazil i had quite a carry and uh armenia fraga had been a partner of mine for six or seven years uh at soros so i felt i knew brazil probably knew just enough to you know be dangerous but i thought i knew brazil pretty well and i'd owned it for a few years and frankly um at the low which was just through 160 and it was the first time the japanese started buying it by the way the whole way they had no interest from 310 to 160</p>
<p>but at 160 they discovered the real um i i did take a bunch off because i just thought this is going to be very tough for brazil to exist with this exchange rate and then at 170 180 the chart turned dramatically so i think i had been 3 billion which was really really stretching the limits of what i would call liquidity but i liked it so much and it kind of grown there organically so i already violated the discipline rule i told you about but um i guess i had about a billion left when it went through 180 and but since i had had three billion i convinced myself it was okay because it was only go to like 205. and uh so it's at 2 40 you know it took a couple weeks and uh i thought this this is uh this is tough and uh so i barfed at least two or three hundred million</p>
<p>right at the low the good news is some of you must know a nudge mahatra he bought it from me internally i have my own guy buy the low from me inside the duquesne but it stayed there for a while and i still liked brazil and i ended up adding between 240 and 220 and basically held a lot of it through about 180 or 190 and still have quite a bit i i think what you may be thinking of at the time is i i started buying brazilian rates at 13 or 14. and they've they violated every chart limit you could possibly think of they went to 19. and this is really really rare for me i don't know when i've ever done it in the past and i just kept adding because this is the stupidest thing i've ever seen it it's trading with risk but i think u.s</p>
<p>two years were 40 basis points you know we kept lowering our rates and that was one of those rare cases where i ignored the charts i told you that i never ignored because i just thought it was just so fundamentally ridiculous and we held them all the way from 18 or 19 these were the january of o2s down to you know uh down to 10. we held that trade for years so is it really you know when you've got something that's like a 1 in 100 for me to violate to that extent when you're violating you're violating the charts it's the charts that'll signal to you to get out yeah we have no i have never used a stop loss in my career i don't use a like a number i know i know that's a discipline system and i know it works but i have like conditions if it starts not acting well relative to news or other things i'm watching you know i'll get out so i probably do have a stop loss in my head</p>
<p>but it's like um another golden rule i has is is january 1 has always been a great resetting of risk for myself and for those of you who gamble you probably know that 95 of the people that go to vegas lose money but the odds are 33 to 32. so 95 percent of the people shouldn't lose money it's because people who get down want to go home and tell their spouse that they made money so they start betting big when they're on losing streaks um and then when they get out go get up they want to tell their spouse they made money so they like they're playing very small when they're doing well and they're playing bigger and bigger when they're doing poorly so we have always believed january 1 is sort of when the house starts and if i'm up i think this is the reason so far we haven't had a down year i'm sure we will have one at some point but when i'm up</p>
<p>i'll play much more aggressively i i see a lot of managers to get up 20 oh i want to book my year i made my high water mark let's go to the beach i'm the opposite and frankly i learned that i learned a lot of that from george um if you're up 20 or 30 percent you're playing the house money that's when you try and get up 60 or 70 percent and you're usually hot at the time any of you who have managed money the most important thing is to manage to monitor yourself i don't know why streaks happen but they happen to happen in baseball they happen in putting they happen in money management and one of my jobs is to know whether i'm hot or cold but i will say just like the brazil thing if i'm down eight or nine percent on the year i'm playing very differently that i'm up 15 or 20 but if there's a great opportunity i'm not going to go oh i'm down on the year i'm going to put my head in the sand i'll play it it's just more of a it's an intuitive general feel the um another time you turned it around was 98 where you looked like you were going to miss the tech bubble</p>
<p>and you were short going into the fall right i think you're thinking in 99 but um what this is a horrible period i i try to black this one you bring back all these nightmares but uh 99 was was the first time in my career and i started in 81 that i i felt my fund was really in trouble and i was in trouble psychologically and it really started in march of 99 i had i had shorted 200 million dollars worth of what i would call low quality internet stocks now mind you this was not early on aol was up eightfold yahoo was up these things had already gone way to the sky so i shorted 200 million dollars worth of internet stocks i would have done more but i have my liquidity rule and i lost about 800 million dollars in 13</p>
<p>days they gapped open like 100 stock would open 130 you try and buy a little would be 170. so i took my i took my 800 million dollar loss i just said get me out you know discipline thing you're talking about indonesia taught me something so i had some currency trade not working and in may we were down 18 and i'd never had a down year and i'd had big drawdowns but always from like up 40 to up 20 or something so the summer wore on and you know i was watching this thing and my charts on the technology stocks looked incredible and it finally dawned on me that greenspan was responding the asian crisis but it wasn't appropriate for the united states so we were running a world monetary</p>
<p>policy but rates were required much higher for here and the charts were just screaming at me to buy tech i think someone said the quote you said at the time was the fed was throwing a party and i was missing it well that's what i said that's what i said it sounds familiar so so i loaded up on tech stocks and uh i think we ended up 42 net on the year and we are still down eight in early november so we made about five billion dollars in november and december all in tech stocks i might as well keep going because the next part's a real nightmare and this is a this is a lesson in money management so in january we still own these tech stocks and we're now up 13 but a lot of my technical indicators were horrendous i mean i think there were 13 new highs</p>
<p>and 242 new lows on a uh year-over-year basis but the market was going up it was all like 10 or 15 tech stocks so i sold everything and was flat and up 13 i went into george and told him why i did it he said that's great you know well i had these two internal managers that i had hired um to buy the go-go tech stocks the ones i didn't know how to pronounce verisign veritas i only knew old stuff like ibm and hewlett-packard who would help me gun the fund in in 99 my god they were making six or seven percent a day while i was sitting out and i just couldn't stand it and uh completely lost my cool and my discipline and after being out for a few weeks and they'd made another 30 or something i jumped back into the tech market and to be fair my momentum charts were bullish but they were bullish</p>
<p>they were bullish for an equity chart but i had seen commodity charts do this and just fall out of the sky because again my stuff is rated change and second derivative anyway i i bought these tech stocks all back and uh about a month and a half later i was down 18 again it was like the nightmare of uh the year before and the worst thing is i knew when they were down when i was down one percent i knew i was toast and uh i just started liquidating told george that i couldn't take it anymore i was leaving and uh told him i was gonna sell everything and we could have a press conference about three weeks but i want to get out of my stuff first and uh went on uh went on sabbatical sent a letter out to my duquesne investors and said my head's all screwed up um i'm gonna uh i'm gonna take a break um you can leave the fund and that's fine um by the way if you</p>
<p>leave it i you won't necessarily get back in if you want to come back in but uh no charge if you stay in we lost one account and uh by labor day that was made by labor day because i had nothing else to do because my kids were going back to school i came back and uh i've had a lot of luck in my life but this was maybe one of the luckiest things ever because i came back in late august right around labor day and oil was screaming upward interest rates were screaming upward it had this huge rally back in the s p and the tech stocks that i had sold and uh everything i had ever looked at told me we're gonna we're gonna go in a recession and plus the nasdaq had been down 30 or 35 percent and uh i had the analysts that i rehired called some companies they all said business</p>
<p>stunk and everybody on wall street was you know 18 earnings and um ed hyman had this simple little model uh 50 dollar 50 g7 rates and i can't remember what the other 25 percent g so i can't remember that anyway it spit out earnings are going to be down 36 percent in the next 12 months and wall street strategists had them up 18 okay so i'm not a rocket scientist but up 18 down 36 and this thing had fit like a glove for one and it fit with everything i believe so fed funds were six and a half two years for 604. we were down at new cane we weren't down 18 we were down nine but i i thrown i finally have a down year that's it it's over man this looked like red meat in front anybody who hadn't had a steak in about 10 years and uh i was fresh the four months off it really helped so i literally put 300 10-year equivalent of the fund</p>
<p>in two-year notes and we made like we made a lot of money um in in the next few months and then ended up i don't know around 15 or 20 nets something like that but that was that was like a miracle so what is it you think that makes a good trader i mean i know you got a lot of friends who are pretty legendary traders all the different styles you've had a lot of people work for you people that you've worked for what is the the common denominator well i i'd say first of all they're extremely competitive you know they want they have an unbelievable will to win and that just if you look at any anybody with a great investment record for whatever reason the people without passion can't compete with them because they have passion and they're willing to just work work harder and and you're in the wrong arena if you think you can compete with those maniacs if you don't have that passion number two um they may have very very different styles</p>
<p>but they're all disciplined and i just told you about four times i wasn't disciplined but um that's over about 30 years it doesn't even matter what your system is but as long as you follow it there are a lot of ways to make money and and with regards to that you really really have to fight your emotions because i have wanted to sell every bottom so bad and a lot of times i'm buying there i'm always doing it never feels great when you're out of turn the other thing i have found is that contrarian investing is is way overrated people tend to um they tend it's intellectually cool to not be with the crowd but the crowd makes 80 money 80 of the time and and they kill themselves at the turns and end up losing as much as it turns as they make during the 80 percent of the time</p>
<p>but i have found contrarian thinking just to be contrarian can be a death trap particularly particularly in uh bonds and currencies because economic fundamentals are what they are it can be a rough ride if it's very crowded but i i think the main thing jeff is you have to be disciplined you have to be unemotional and to me the really great ones you have to really be able to play you have to have courage you have to play big when when the opportunity's there make hay while the sun shines whatever the term is one more question before we take some q a you know we're we've brought all our foreign exchange and local market traders from the americas and a few from asia and europe here today to talk about over the next two days how to grow your risk how to grow how to grow your risk how to take more how to get bigger um you seem to have no problem</p>
<p>driving it although you had the help from a mentor to push yourself to get bigger to take more risk are there any other besides having someone push you what helps you be confident enough to step it up to the level i think you just have to follow you know whatever your whatever your style or whatever your system is you just have to follow a disciplined pattern and you have to teach yourself that you're good i mean i can remember in 87 and 88 in 80 in 87 i caught the crash and i was on a couple magazine covers so i was really smart okay but i was convinced we were going into a depression and 88 the stock market kept going i can remember getting up two nights a week throwing up and thinking oh my god i went to boden i never got a degree i can't be a plumber what i'm going to do this this might be random what what you know i might have just gotten lucky for six years because</p>
<p>you're a bull market playing a trend and you know i had made 42 a year compounded and i was thinking that way so it's not easy but i think if you follow a disciplined system you just have to watch your own results and you have to believe in yourself and success breeds success and again one of the things with me is i know when i'm hot and i know when i'm cold and you have to learn to play big when you're on a streak a lot of times when i'm cold i'll just start trading really small and the whole purpose of the trading is to find out when i've got it again and every once in a while you'll think you'll got it and you hit eight in a row and then you bet big and ooh i missed and that's tough that's probably the toughest thing you could ever do that's the old whip saw term but you know you just have to dust yourself off but i would say the way to get big is follow discipline watch yourself and then just grow organically what i would never do ever</p>
<p>is if you swing and you miss is put on a big trade just to get even i got to get out of the trap that is a death that's a death sentence don't bet big and unless a you love your thesis and b you're hot now if you really really love your thesis and you've had a lot of successes in the past that's what i'm talking about for example when i put that treasury bet on when i came back in 2000 that's fine but don't ever bet big just because you think this is the you know the way to get out of a mistake you've made so when you're losing i think this is key get small keep trading was 2000 the only time where you said that's it i really gotta get my head out of this i'm gonna square everything up and go away yeah jeff i was exhausted i'm it had more to do with all sorts of psychological factors which you have to know when you're a trader but i had been running the most public hedge fund for 12 years with a guy</p>
<p>who had a need for publicity because his his philanthropy and his status were enhanced i don't think he was doing it at the time because of his ego it enhanced his position in philanthropy well i'm a private person as you know if you try and find anything out on duquesne and i was just tired and exhausted and in 99 i think money managed a little bit like a boxer and body blows you get these body blows and 99 took a lot out of me and do it 2 000 and my kids were 9 or 10 i just so yeah that's the only time i did it but let me tell you there have been 10 times when i wanted to do it and at those times i i just trade small suck it up and try and remember all the successes i've had in the past and this will end at some point i'm really not that stupid which at the time you feel like you are all right uh why don't we take a few questions anyone want to kick off peter</p>
<p>of success not not early but after a mature string of success is when they're at their worst they get sloppy they get overconfident um so i would kind of disagree and i i just want to ask you specifically why do you think that when someone's doing well that it's a time to take more risks well i i believe in streaks and i don't know whether you do disagree because what you're talking about is someone who loses their discipline um and you cannot allow you make a good point you cannot allow yourself when you're doing well to start thinking your god and lose your discipline but i i do believe that life and trading runs in streaks and if you're still disciplined without with what you're doing when you're up 20 with clients money you have the right</p>
<p>if you really like an idea to bet more than when you're down 10 percent and i'm not saying oh i'm up 20 let's go shoot for the moon what i am saying everything else equal if you're playing with house money and if you're doing well and you're trading well you should definitely take bigger positions otherwise but no i'm not saying i'm up 20 let's just get and i've hit eight in a row let's get reckless so i'm not sure we do disagree i may not have articulated my position well but if if you look at the best part of my record at soros i literally didn't make a mistake for five years literally not one and then for two years i stunk okay and if i had gone in any of those five years from basically 89 to 95 well i've done too well i need to take a break you know i probably would have lost half</p>
<p>my net worth that i have now so different strokes for different folks tom yeah when we of had a uh that the risk management system was you um and i think it might be interesting yeah if you talk a little bit about how you thought of the money i don't remember when you walked in but this is a terrific question um because i have never had a well i did but i am paying attention to it and it's what tom's alluding to i have never had a fancy quantitative risk management control system overseeing me and by the way either did george soros</p>
<p>in the 25 years he ran the fun before i did and between us there's one down years since 1969. there's no var at duquesne well there was because the banks came in and made us put it in uh after 98. okay but i believe that every once in a while usually about every 10 years you have a financial crisis and all these systems that are based on historic trends and what happens when a does this and b does this spit out a formula and they work 90 95 of the time but when when you really really need risk management they break down because by definition of a financial crisis which i'm sure everybody here knows because we had a recent one correlations just go wacko</p>
<p>um the stuff that has correlated for years breaks down and you start seeing changes that make no sense whatsoever and my risk management system is and i i believe this is true with george although we never talked about it you know if i own let's say in today's world uh the last 10 years at least if if you own stocks and your short bonds that most of those 10 years has been the same bet and if you're long the euro that's probably a long risk bet and you just kind of get a feel in your head of where your matrix is and i can go in the gym and watch cnbc um at 11 o'clock and i have probably if you include the whole firm hundreds of positions on and all i see on that stupid little ticker is what the s p is</p>
<p>doing and i can probably tell you our p l within two million dollars just because my head knows what my pound or my euro position will be doing and my goal position based on that and so i sort of have this internal thing where i'm watching everything but the reason i love the human side as opposed to the quantitative side is there's nothing like my p l and you will pick up oh c is not acting the way it was with a the last eight years and there's something funny and then you'll start seeing more funniness going on and i have always thought that if my p l extra if things went well that day and i'm losing money and i examine what went on and if that continues something is really starting to go haywire in the system so my risk management system has always been what i've described that knowledge and then my gut and watching my daily p l</p>
<p>and if the daily p l starts acting in a way it shouldn't instead of going to some quantitative var or beta model oh i'm okay the model says i'm okay to me these models are not only okay they can get you in huge trouble by causing you a false sense of security um when when things start going awry because the model will tell you you're okay and and you will see things happen you've never seen before whereas if if you are a intuitive human traitor you should be able to use your instinct to just start cutting when things aren't acting right you ever if you're thinking about the correlations if you're along a lot of smps we say well i'm bullish the euro bearish the dollar but i'm not going to take that big position in that because they're correlated yeah and and that gets back to this question if if i've got a strong opinion and i'm doing well and we're up 20 percent</p>
<p>and this is what happened in the early 90s and i've got eight positions and they're all in the sec same direction it's an eight times texas hedge i have no issue with it but if i'm down six or seven percent i might just take my favorite of those positions and press that alone but but yeah i am constantly um weighing that and and you know one of the one of the one of the reasons i plowed into those brazilian bonds is they had traded with risk since i'd owned them it was crazy a couple times they moved 200 basis points because you had something going on here and it had nothing to do with the brazilian economy and about a month before they turn before big signal they turned was the s p kept crashing into the financial crisis and they stopped correlating</p>
<p>and that they were 18 or 19 and that's when i knew they were golden because i had watched some trade with risk for two years and my antenna the intuitive part i'm talking about i said oh they're not trading with risk and this is a really cool thing because i'm long them and i actually that's when i bought more of them all right one more scott uh i am the worst hirer in the world um and you know my mother-in-law says i'm an idiot savant she's probably right i you know so far i've been able to compound money above a random level but um i just i just took that to someone else in my firm</p>
<p>so um if i was hiring a money manager the first thing i'd look for is if all i heard was they never made a mistake and they're telling me about all their wins that's a big red flag um the great money managers i've met they generally don't tell you about a lot of their wins they tell you about a lot of the losses um and there's a there's an immodesty about them but yeah i would definitely look for discipline um the first thing i do when i look at the records i go right to the bear market periods and see how they did in those uh and look at the quality of the record because i hiring money managers i'm okay actually it's analysts that i have a problem with but um yeah i would i would look at all the things i'm talking about but i think you can learn a ton from the record just by looking how they did in certain years and when you see an outlier you ask them</p>
<p>because there'll be there'll always be one or two inconsistencies in there like i was flat in 96 pretty easy year why turns out it was the indonesian rupiah but um you know and i think you need to delve in what the reasons were in those unusual unusual period or are they just a bull market creature where they wrote a trend what are your thoughts on the markets today going forward any big views how are we going to make money next year well i i've had i i believe maybe the worst year i've had relative the opportunity we're up about 10 percent somewhere in that area and i think the opportunities have been tremendous this year by hindsight of course i i made the decision we had a very good 07 and a good 08. when that when the government got involved to the extent that they did and look at all the factors that my skill set</p>
<p>was was not as valuable as it had been in the past because i was dealing with a set of variables that i just i didn't want to bet big and jeff i still think this is one of the most unanalyzable periods i've ever dealt with because i tend to look at history and historical i try to find similar instances and i was on a roll until september of 08 because it looked like the 30s but worse to me because we came in with more leverage and then we started running a monetary in a fiscal policy exact opposite of what we did in the 30s as well now so that's my big qualifier or hedge since i run a hedge fund um and i'll start out by saying this is this is more uncertainty that i would usually have and no one knows and if you meet anybody who really thinks they know what's happened next year stay away from because they're an idiot okay um but</p>
<p>having said that here's how i here's how i see where we are um first of all usually in a in a big time financial crisis and we've seen this in a lot of emerging markets usually something really productive comes out of it and you usually get very positive structural reform now i am no fan of george bush for those of 43 for those of you who have known me for quite a while but i do think it was kind of bad luck at least for for structural reform that this thing blew up um on on the smaller government side of the equation's watch um and i blame that guy for a lot of things but i don't blame him for the financial crisis to me the the seeds of this started 20 years ago when greenspan took over for volcker and then he decided he won a recession so we've just been you know we've gone from 140 percent of gdp to 380 on debt</p>
<p>and you know it went parabolic and he ignored it so the the problem i see is we had this big mess and instead of getting healthy response to it which would be demanded in an em country and an em country would come out of it usually much better and a lot of times rise from the ashes which is why i think if you look probably the countries that weathered the this the best were obviously latin american asia asia went through the asian financial crisis and the latin american countries were on their deathbed in the early 80s and they were they they they made the right response to it eventually and the seeds of that and the benefits of that went for a long time and i i think the last really horrendous thing i saw in my career was was this whole 70s thing in the end of it and carter was sort of the epitome of it and out of carter we got volcker</p>
<p>and we got reagan and we basically got a 20-year bull market out of some guys that were really to take some serious serious pain for two or three years so my problem with with where we are today is we went into this thing we have this thing and not only have we not gotten structural reform we've done everything wrong and it's all kicked the can down the road and we got into this thing through a to me a reckless monetary policy and not willing to take the pain and not willing to take a recession and ironically i call it the curse of the reserve currency which is you know this thing the curse of oil that the country is well under the ground can yeah the problem with being a reserve currency is we're allowed to get away with non-reform and and behavior and you keep doing it and doing it and doing it and normally the markets would give you a signal and they would save you from yourself</p>
<p>before it was too late i am deeply afraid that all this stuff we're doing it's the wrong answer i mean capping capping bankers pay this is this our response and all this other stuff why don't we just get you know knock down you know instead of dealing with the real issue which is leverage to lose a monetary policy you know it's all this populist nonsense out there so i am convinced that this crisis we've just had is going to be followed by a bigger crisis because we didn't do what we needed to do in response to this crisis and now is where it gets unanswerable and unanalyzable which is our response to it which is how we got into it which is more liquidity you know let's not have any pain 10 percent unemployment buying 20 to 25 billion in</p>
<p>either treasuries or mortgages a week makes everybody feel good causes another asset bubble but it's going to cause hell down the road and and in this one i think the fed and the treasury were big enough to arrest it at the next one i think there's a good chance that they'll be the problem i think we're going to have a sovereign crisis due to everything we're doing now and normally it would be arrested because the bond market would give you a signal but with china trying to hold their own currency down so they're buying treasuries korea everybody knows who's intervening every night brazil will be intervening and we're intervening i mean we're buying 20 to 25 billion isn't it nice that that we don't want to we don't want to target asset prices at the fed on the way up but for some reason we're buying them isn't that targeting but anyway um so</p>
<p>that this liquidity that they're putting in there you can't go oh the economy stinks so i hate the stock market it doesn't work um this thing if you have the money supply growing a lot faster than industrial production the stock market is generally going to go up that's just the way it works that's that's where the money goes but at some point we're going to get a signal when that signal is i don't know it could be in three months or it could be in three years so basically i'm pretty useless other than telling you i would not be shocked at all if we take out the 680 and the s p again on the downside but that could be in three or four years if you put a gun to my head i'd say given where liquidity is now if january earnings are strong and i i suspect they will be and the markets are hot enough these guys will end qe at the end of march is what they're saying uh if we get weak again i'm not sure i</p>
<p>believe them but if they end qe i would be willing to entertain the fact since all my long-term thesis tend to happen before i think they're going to happen that it'd be very unlikely that risk would be up year to year in 2010 that sometime in the first quarter before the end of march we'll start backtracking when the big crisis comes i don't know i personally we're playing a low gross because i can't figure it out uh we are tilted toward long risk we're we're in the liquidity thing um my favorite currency is gold again very popular not a contrarian vet but my thesis there is quite simple that just like we had an anomaly in 92 with germany and britain we have an</p>
<p>anomaly now and the anomaly is if you look at the world balance sheet it's it's okay in total but it's obviously ridiculously imbalanced so our structurally impaired balance sheet is somebody else's decent balance sheet so debt to gdp in china is 120 130 here it's 370 and you know you could go on but that's so basically because we're we're the reserve currency and because no one else wants their currency to go up we are running moral monetary policy and since we are have a structurally impaired balance sheet for the world as a whole that monetary policy is way too loose it's appropriate for us possibly i don't think it is but you could certainly argue it is it's definitely not appropriate for the world and everybody hates their own currency and that's why i like gold and then we're all so long a bunch of commodity currencies basically for the same reason but i would put</p>
<p>gold at the bottom of gold at the top if i was from mars of my currency regime followed by selective commodity currencies and i would put the pound and the dollar at the bottom of us because they have structural problems bonds are incredibly interesting because they are the stupidest price they are ridiculous but again my discipline requires um i'm not just a value guy i need charts i need catalyst and i think they're a one-way bet except kerry but the carry's big um but i am salivating um to short the bond market in major size um that could happen tomorrow morning it could happen in four months it could happen a year i don't quite know but you know do i have a second yeah okay so so in 81 what launched my career was we had</p>
<p>18 short-term rates we had about 14 or 15 inflation and the long bomb was yielding 14. and we had a crazy guy running the fed named paul volcker who was going to do anything to smash inflation and all the bond guys were bearish and it cost 400 they got 400 basis points of carry by being short bonds okay and interestingly the only bond bulls were equity guys michael steinhardt roy neuberger george soros myself although nobody ever heard of me um and we could see that this guy volcker was going to win okay now it's a very interesting situation it costs you 400 basis points not to own the bonds but to be short the bonds we got in my opinion a crazy guy running the fed okay he's hell-bent on inflating the bond guys are all bullish because they're getting 400 carry they they</p>
<p>can't believe how what a party they're having the equity guys are all going this is a disaster when i go and i meet ceos every one of them thinks we're gonna have inflation i don't know whether right or not but you know so to me it's almost the mirror of 30 years ago when was george soros's one down year 1981 he lost 22 percent why he was long bonds he was just six months early i don't want to be six months early and trash myself but i'm salivating but it's you know i don't know the timing of it and last question your uh personal life one thing that is well known is your big steelers fan you're on the boards of a bunch of uh of charities but i know that your real focus is with the harlem children's zone why did you pick that one well i i hit the lottery um with this guy canada but but basically it's a pretty simple story um when i went to work for for george he had just retired</p>
<p>from money management and he he he wanted to give away 500 million a year i had no money so i never thought about philanthropy but when i started making money i had a i had a personal mentor and it was just it seemed like the right thing to do but living in new york um first of all i'm kind of parochial because i came from pittsburgh so i wasn't really into the arts and i thought giving to the philharmonic and the moma was i don't know they seem to have plenty of money and plenty of supporters and i had a good friend i just met named paul jones and you know we were we had a lot of discussions about poverty in the area so i joined the robin hood board and we had a board meeting up with the site at this place called reedlin center for for children and families and i went up this sort of like dilapidated stairs up into this little room and uh i meet this guy jeff canada and within like an hour and a half the hair was standing back on the back of my i said</p>
<p>this is like one of the greatest most dynamic leaders i've ever met what's he doing in this little room and then uh five or six years later i was on the real board it was jeff not me that thought up the concept of harlem children's zone presented to a board i mean this is like discovering you know bill gates in a garage uh as far as i'm concerned and and uh so you know he's he's he's had a massive impact with a hundred square blocks up there and now as you guys probably know obama's trying to use our model to do it in 20 cities and uh it's it's outside of my family it's been the joy of my life but i just got lucky and uh i don't know why i was destined to meet this guy but i did i just want to take one minute and i want to introduce arnold prasad my boss he runs fxlm uh you guys should know me by now at least this time of the year no we are a top bank guys</p>
